Bash Script to Create Usernames using AWK,"<p>I am writing a bash script that takes information from a text file called &quot;studentlist.txt&quot; and that text file gets passed to the script through a positional parameter. The text file contains firstname, lastname, and ID number. Using that information, I have to create a username and the username is a combination of First Name Initial, Full Last Name, and Last Four digits of the ID number. Afterwards I have to use the usernames created to delete users from the OS. So far, this what I coded thus far.</p>
<pre><code>#! /bin/bash

studentlist=$1 ### Storing the Positional Parameter into the variable called studentlist

if [ $# != 0 ] ### If a positional parameter does exist, then do the following.
        then
                initial=`cat ${studentlist} | awk {'print $1'} | cut -c1`; ### Print the First Field in Studentlist, which is First Name for us. And we only care about the initial.
                lastname=`cat ${studentlist} | awk {'print $2'}`; ### Print the Entire Last Name.
                id=`cat ${studentlist} | awk {'print $3'} | grep -o '....$'`; ### Print only the Last Four Digits of the Student ID.
                username=&quot;$initial$lastname$id&quot; ### Concatenate all the variables to create the username.
fi

echo $username ### Print to the Screen all usernames created.
</code></pre>
<p>When I run the script, the following shows up on the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to the script Remove_Accounts
This script uses utilizes GetOpts, for more information on the script use the flag -h

</code></pre>
<p>Which isn't what I want, I only want the full username to show up for which user. For example, the usernames should be showing up as the following:</p>
<pre><code>JDoe5678

ORaborn6789

LGillan7891

SBisram8912

KEscudero9123

</code></pre>
<p>The text file &quot;studentlist.txt&quot;, contains the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Doe 12345678</p>
<p>Oswaldo Raborn 23456789</p>

Can I compile Qt with Emscripten without using Qt for Webassembly?,"<p>As <code>Emscripten</code> can compile most C++ code to webassembly (WASM), I was asking myself what is the point of <code>Qt for Webassembly</code>.
The former will keep the C++ code's license (LGPL), the latter would require to license under the GPL.</p>

<p>Is it technically possible to compile Qt with Emscripten, so I have the freedom to avoid the GPL license? Maybe someone with a deeper understanding of Qt might explain what was required under the hood for the WASM platform support.</p>

Cloud Run error: Container failed to start,"<p>I am failing to get a basic Angular app deploying to Google Cloud Run.

Webots - BoundingObject of Robot becomes null after world reload (how to prevent that?),"<p>I've a Robot node with children = [SolidCylinderJoint]. SolidCylinderJoint is a proto that I created, which defines a DEF node as a field, i.e.,</p>
<pre><code>field SFNode geometry DEF BODY Cylinder {

<p>Now, this works great, but as soon as I hit &quot;Reload World&quot; or restart webots, the boundingObject becomes NULL again. I think this is happening because the robot node is loaded before the Proto, and at the time it's trying to set the boundingObject to BODY, it doesn't find that definition and hence defaults to NULL.</p>

Paste into SSH terminal capitalizes last character and doesn&#39;t allow me to edit it,"<p>I'm running Terminal on my Mac and ssh'ing into a Linux host.  I've had 2 issues around copying and pasting text into my Terminal:</p>

<ol>
<li>When I'm just running local Terminal commands on my Mac (not though ssh), I sometimes get weird characters around text that I paste, like <code>00~pastedtext01~</code>.  I googled around and found out that this was apparently due to ""bracketed paste"".  I was able to fix this problem by running the command <code>printf '\e[?2004l'</code> whenever it happens.</li>
<li>When I ssh into my Linux host, when I paste text it will often capitalize the last character of whatever I'm pasting, and the cursor will turn gray and I won't be able to type additional characters or delete characters from whatever I pasted.  My only two options at that point are to either ^C to break onto the next line without running the command, or hit enter and run the messed up command.  It doesn't happen 100% of the time.  If I copy something and then repeatedly paste it into the shell, I'll see this issue occur about 90% of the time.  I have no idea why it's apparently non-deterministic like this.  I thought this might also be due to ""bracketed paste"" issues, but no matter how many times I run the commands <code>printf '\e[?2004l'</code> and <code>set enable-bracketed-paste off</code>, the issue persists.  It even persists when I exit and re-ssh to the host, so I know it's not due to running any program like vim, since the problem still happens even immediately after I've ssh'ed into the host.  Can someone please help???  This is killing my productivity!</li>

Is there a way to modify fetched results with a predicate after they are initialized?,"<p>I am trying to build a search view for an existing CoreData app (simple logging app).
I have all the data stored with CoreData and is fetched with the <strong>@FetchRequest</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>@State private var searchPredicate: NSPredicate? = NSPredicate(format: ""title contains[c] %@"", """")

@FetchRequest( entity: Item.entity(), sortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Item.title, ascending: true)],
      predicate: NSPredicate(format: ""title contains[c] %@"", ""h"")
    ) 
var items: FetchedResults&lt;Item&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It now only fetches the items that pass the predicate test which in this case are all the ones that contain an ""h"".
I then display the results in a List in the body of the SearchView:</p>

<pre><code>List {

  ForEach(Items) { Item in

      ListViewItem(title: Item.title!, subTitle: Item.subTitle!, createdAt: ""\(Item.createdAt!)"")

     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then created a new class ""Searchbar"" which is called in the searchview and is supposed to create a predicate based on the input of the search field and then pass it on as a Binding to the parent where then based on that predicate the correct items can be displayed.</p>

<p>Calling the searchbar at the top of a VStack in the searchview:</p>

<pre><code>SearchBar(text: $searchText, predicate: $searchPredicate)
</code></pre>

<p>The Bindings change depending on the user input in the ""searchBar"":</p>

<pre><code>func searchBar(_ searchBar: UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText: String) {

    text = searchText
    predicate = NSPredicate(format: ""title contains[c] %@"", searchText)

 }
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good...</p>

<p>The problem I have now run into is that we have a predicate that works but can't be called within the @Fetchrequest in the definitions since it would be called before its initialized.</p>

<pre><code>@State private var searchPredicate: NSPredicate? = NSPredicate(format: ""title contains[c] %@"", """")


@FetchRequest(
    entity: Item.entity(),
    sortDescriptors: [
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Item.title, ascending: true)
    ],
    predicate: searchPredicate
) var items: FetchedResults&lt;Item&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the error that the property initializer can't be run before self is available which is logical but makes me wonder and brings me back to my question: <strong>Is there a way to modify fetched results with a predicate after they are initialized?</strong></p>

<p>I have also tried calling predicate related methods on the fetched results in the ForEach() statement but none of them seemed to have worked.</p>

<p>If there are any questions please do not hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>After upgrading from VS 2017 to 2019, it started complaining about certain private fields that have an underscore prefix (like <code>_exampleOne</code>). It says: <code>Naming rule violation: Prefix '_' is not expected</code>.</p>

<p>I use underscores to signify ""technicality"" fields: the ones which are closely tied to specific properties or methods and shouldn't be manipulated directly. For instance, when a manual property implementation is required for event raising or other purposes.</p>

<p>Can I make Visual Studio stop complaining about those specific problems without turning off IDE1006 completely or suppressing it on a per-use basis? Those are the only solutions the little yellow light bulb suggests.</p>

<p>I've tried to explicitly supply an SQS endpoint in my bean, but it still attempts to connect to <code>169.254.169.254</code> resulting in the error above:</p>

<pre><code>public AmazonSQSAsync sqsClient() {
   EndpointConfiguration endpointConfig = new AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration(
        ""sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"",

<p>Although I'm not certain about this, I suspect that the error is occurring because I'm running the app locally on my dev machine and so it couldn't resolve to the endpoint. But I'm not entirely sure about this too because I'm running other AWS services in the same app using the AWS SDK and I don't have this error.</p>

<p>I've the following dependencies in my pom.xml and it appears that having any one of them will cause the error to occur. That's, I don't even have to create the beans to have that error. Adding these dependencies will immediately, for some reason, causes the SDK to attempt to resolve that endpoint and fail with that error.</p>

Is it possible to import specific icons from expo vector-icons?,"<p>I am looking to reduce app size and am trying to understand my options. I know I should probably eject and not use Expo, and I plan to eventually do that, but am looking to understand how everything works before I do that.</p>

<p>One of the things I was thinking was importing only certain icons as to avoid importing the entire expo vector icons library in modules where I pull icons. Currently I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps this is misguided and if so I'd appreciate the tip, but is it possible/worth importing only certain icons so as to decrease bringing in the entire expo vector icons library? Does it matter?</p>

<p>Lastly I know I could also probably just save those icons I use individually in my assets, but wanted to see if there was an easier solution before going all manual. Thanks.</p>

Transaction Management in Google Bigquery,"<p>This issue is regarding transaction management in BigQuery. I am trying to insert into multiple tables from my code.

Next JS with styled components component library,"<p>Im trying to get next js to load properly with a transpiled styled components component library. Here is a simple repo for reproducing the problem: <a href=""https://github.com/vongohren/fouc-example"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/vongohren/fouc-example</a></p>

<p>So what happens is that I have a small app that renders the components, but it does not showcase the style on the SSR request, only when the client has been loaded.</p>

<p>But it is not able to catch the css from the components. Only the components built in the SSR function itself, and not the components I import.</p>

<p>How can I debug this and figure out how the CSS can be attached on the SSR request as well, and not just the loading of the JS.</p>

<p>I was able to get something to work when using <a href=""https://github.com/callstack/linaria"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/callstack/linaria</a> in the components library, because that outputs a CSS file, I was able to import and add to the SSR rendering.

Jupyter Notebook and Colab Keep Crashing From Running Random Forest Model,"<p>I currently have a dataset that has been encoded and it looks like this:</p>

<p>I then separated the independent and dependent variables as such, followed by separating the dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn packages.</p>

<pre><code>X = df[['year', 'manufacturer', 'make', 'condition', 'cylinders', 'fuel', 'odometer', 'transmission', 'type']]

<p>Afterwards, I used a RandomForestClassifier to model the dataset:</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn import metrics

# Create a Gaussian Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=0, max_features = 'sqrt', n_jobs=4, verbose =1)

# train the model using the training sets y_pred = clif.predict(X_test)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# prediction on test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(""Accuracy:"", accuracy)

<p>However, everytime I run the code, my notebook crashes due to not having enough RAM. I've tried running the code on Colab (with GPU as well) and it crashes too. Is it due to the sheer amount of entries? I also tried using an SVM model to train the dataset, I ran the model overnight and nothing came about.</p>

Pinning down a discrepancy in ddot between two machines,"<p>I currently have two machines which produce different outputs for an instance of <code>np.dot</code> on two vectors. Without digging through the many layers of abstraction leading from NumPy to BLAS, I was able to reproduce the discrepancy in <code>scipy.linalg.blas.ddot</code>, so I assume an explanation of the discrepancy in BLAS also explains the discrepancy in NumPy. Concretely, consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg.blas import ddot

u = np.array([0.13463703107579461093, -0.07773272613450200874, -0.98784132994666418170])
v = np.array([-0.86246572448831815283, -0.03715105562531360872, -0.50475010960748223354])
a = np.dot(v, u)
b = v[0]*u[0] + v[1]*u[1] + v[2]*u[2]
c = ddot(v, u)
print(f'{a:.25f}')
print(f'{b:.25f}')
print(f'{c:.25f}')
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the following outputs:</p>

<pre><code>                      Machine 1                   Machine 2
a   0.3853810478481685120044631 0.3853810478481685675156143
b   0.3853810478481685120044631 0.3853810478481685120044631
c   0.3853810478481685120044631 0.3853810478481685675156143
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, the following piece of Cython gives rise to the same discrepancy:</p>

<pre><code>cimport scipy.linalg.cython_blas
cimport numpy as np
import numpy as np

cdef np.float64_t run_test(np.double_t[:] a, np.double_t[:] b):
    cdef int ix, iy, n
    ix = iy = 1
    n = 3
    return scipy.linalg.cython_blas.ddot(&amp;n, &amp;a[0], &amp;ix, &amp;b[0], &amp;iy)

a = np.array([0.13463703107579461093, -0.07773272613450200874, -0.98784132994666418170])
b = np.array([-0.86246572448831815283, -0.03715105562531360872, -0.50475010960748223354])
print(f'{run_test(a, b):.25f}')
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm trying to understand what could give rise to this.</p>

<p>The machines in question run Windows 10 (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U) and Windows Server 2016 (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6140) respectively.</p>

<p>In both cases have I set up fresh conda environments with nothing but <code>numpy</code>, <code>scipy</code>, <code>cython</code>, and their dependencies. I've run checksums on the environments to ensure that the binaries that end up being included agree and verified that the outputs of <code>np.__config__.show()</code> match up. Similarly I checked that the outputs of <code>mkl.get_version_string()</code> agree on the two machines.</p>

<p>This leads me to think that the problem might be in differences in hardware. I did not look into what instructions end up being executed (lacking a straightforward way to debug the Cython code on Windows/MSVC), but I <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hskdteyh.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">checked</a> that both machines support AVX2/FMA, which seemed like it could be one source of the discrepancy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I did find that the two machines support different instruction sets, though. Concretely</p>

<pre><code>          Machine 1 (i7)       Machine 2 (Xeon)
AVX                    Y                      Y
AVX2                   Y                      Y
AVX512CD               N                      Y
AVX512ER               N                      N
AVX512F                N                      Y
AVX512PF               N                      N
FMA                    Y                      Y
</code></pre>

<p>I am, however, not aware of a good way to determine if this by itself is sufficient to explain the discrepancy, or if it's a red herring(?)</p>

<p>So my question becomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting from the above, what are some natural steps to try to pin down the cause of the discrepancy? Is it assembly time, or is there something more obvious?</p>

How can I wait reducer update data from API on event onClick with redux and redux - Saga?,"<p>I'm struggle with the problem and I really need some help. This is my workflow:
in onClick() event, I start a action to transfer a data object to reducer and to reduxSaga. When calling API is success, I use put() function in Redux Saga to update state with the response from API. Despite every operation seems to be synchronous, I get old data on the first time I click the button. Here is my code, please see and help me.</p>

<p>Here is my action:</p>

<pre><code>export const clickToDownloadExcelFile = (data) =&gt; ({
  type: constants.CLICK_TO_EXPORT_EXCEL_MERCHANT_LIST_FILE,
  data,
});

<p>Here is my reducer:</p>

<pre><code>case constants.CLICK_TO_EXPORT_EXCEL_MERCHANT_LIST_FILE:
      return { ...state };

    case constants.CLICK_TO_EXPORT_EXCEL_MERCHANT_LIST_FILE_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, dataExcelFile: action.data };

    case constants.CLICK_TO_EXPORT_EXCEL_MERCHANT_LIST_FILE_FAILED:
      return { ...state };

      applyDate: actions.data.applyDate,
      expirationDate: actions.data.expirationDate,
      contract: actions.data.contract,

    const data = yield call(apiFeeMerchantListExportExcel, sendData);
    yield put({

  } catch (error) {
    yield put({
      type: constants.CLICK_TO_EXPORT_EXCEL_MERCHANT_LIST_FILE_FAILED,
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>here is my onClick function:</p>

<pre><code>exportFile = async () =&gt; {
    const { clickToDownloadExcelFile, dataSearch, dataExcelFile } = this.props;

    /**/ I start a action right here when I click on the button:**

    await clickToDownloadExcelFile(dataSearch);
     **// I want to get updated data from API in here. have any solution to do it?**
    console.log('dataExcelFile', dataExcelFile);

  };</p>

<pre><code>takeLatest(constants.CLICK_TO_EXPORT_EXCEL_MERCHANT_LIST_FILE, loadDataExportExcelMerchantList),

<p>I think because I call action to call Api and Update store exactly in side onClick(function), show after clickToDownLoadExcelFile run and api need some time to response, it keep doing the next code without waiting, so  the result of dataExcelFile is doesn't update at the first onClick. do you have any solution for that?</p>

I have also tried doing <code>.excludeSwitches(['enable-automation'])</code> which also didn't help.</p>

<p>Has anyone found the solution to this? I have been searching for hours and have come up empty-handed.</p>

Impact of setting random.seed() to recreate a simulated behaviour and choosing the seed,"<p>I am doing a scheduling simulation in python which is full determinstic. So, when I have the same input and parameters I always get the same output.</p>

<p>Now I want to randomize the initial starting state of the simulation and compare the output of two (or more) different simulation parameters. To compare the ""same randomized initial starting state"" I want to set the <code>random.seed()</code> with an initial value, which should stay the same for all comparisions of different schedulers. Furthermore I want to see the behaviour for one scheduler on different initial states so I have to change the <code>random.seed()</code>. This I have to do of course for all schedulers.</p>

<p>Now my question is, what impact has the seed on the ""randomness"" of the random generator? For example does it matter if I choose as a seed 1 or 100? And because I want to use different seeds for the same scheduler and compare it to the other ones, can I simply use e.g. the seeds 1 to 10 or must my seeds be ""more random""?</p>

<p>For clarification, I use the random generator for distributing tasks initial on different cores and compare the output to ""my optimal (deterministic) initial distribution"". I want to get a wide-spread of different distributions with my choosen seeds.</p>

How can I call the Wiki REST Api from an Azure DevOps extension?,"<p>The <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-dashboard-widget?view=azure-devops#part-2-hello-world-with-azure-devops-services-rest-api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Add a dashboard widget</a> tutorial explains how to call the work item REST API using a <code>VSS.require(""TFS/WorkItemTracking/RestClient"")</code>d rest client.</p>

<p>I want to do the same, but for the <strong>Wiki</strong> Rest API. There certainly is a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=azure-devops#scopes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scope</a> for this: <code>vso.wiki</code>.</p>

<p>However, I cannot find the equivalent of <code>""TFS/WorkItemTracking/RestClient""</code> for wiki. Maybe it is as simple as <code>""TFS/Wiki/RestClient""</code>, but even if it was, what are the names and parameters of the functions I can use? I don't find that documented anywhere, and I don't want to have to figure that out by trial-and-error, each time publishing a new extension and seeing if it works.</p>

<p>And looking at <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/reference/client/rest-clients?view=azure-devops"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">REST Clients</a>, there does not even seem to be a Wiki Rest Client.</p>

<p>So <strong>how can I access the Wiki Rest API from an Azure DevOps extension?</strong> Is there perhaps an example somewhere, that google has been successful in hiding from me?</p>

<hr>

<p>N.B. I do know about the <a href=""https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vsts-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/wiki/6.0/httpExamples/pagesBatch/GET_wiki_pageBatch_WithPageViews.json"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">REST API Specs</a>, but the mapping to REST client is not self-evident and apparently.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-extension-api/blob/master/src/Wiki/WikiClient.ts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azure DevOps Web API clients and contracts</a>, however, a brief grep revealed it does not contain the latest and greatest (pre-release) ""pagesBatch"" feature, and I did not find a relevant branch / tag either.</p>

Importing mails to Mailcow from Protonmail,"<p>I'm attempting to import emails from Protonmail to Mailcow.</p>
<p>Mailcow, of course, has the sync jobs functionality so my first approach was to create one such job for pulling emails from ProtonMail Bridge. The Bridge runs locally at 127.0.0.1 with port 1143 for IMAP and port 1025 for SMTP. I tried exposing it with Ngrok, by typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>./ngrok http https://127.0.0.1:1143
</code></pre>
<p>Then, opening a sync job in Mailcow's UI (Mail Setup --&gt; Sync jobs) with the URL provided by Ngrok and 1143 as port got me this:</p>

"postgres No space left on device, even with a big enough volume and only 10 records","<p>This particular service is Dockerized and its infraestructure runs on Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Five days ago, Postgres complained about no space left in a volume of 2GB. It was about the logs not having enough space, so instead of trying to solve that problem, we just upgraded the volume to 10GB. In five days all that space has been used. Now we have the green light to investigate.</p>

<p>There are only 10 records in the whole database, so clearly this is not a common issue, nor it is related to data.</p>

<p>Any insight is appreciated. For more information, files or anything else, I can supply'em. I'm not sure what else I can add right now.</p>

<p>Have looked at the url but it just sends me in circles thus making no progress. What I'm looking for is an example that at least sends a file to the server without errors/ warnings. If the uploadadapter can be <strong>scraped</strong> and something else except CKfinder can be used that's fine. For now I guess the problem is most likely to be in the Vue component.</p>

So I'm new to using jQuery and I was trying to make a <code>div</code> that I can drag and resize. So I followed the steps on the jQuery website. The problem was, the div was only draggable. I thought that it might be because I combined two functions. I then just tried to make it resizable but it still didn't work. So I discard the code followed a youtube video and still, the div was only draggable and not resizable. If I had to guess, the problem is not due to the javascript but the HTML or CSS.</p>
<p>Here is the HTML:</p>
<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div id=&quot;htmlWrap&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;html&quot; class=&quot;ui-widget-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;aheadWrap&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;div id=&quot;htsub&quot;&gt;Interesting subtitle&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div id=&quot;htlogoWrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;htlogo&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/14/22/49/bison-1980589_960_720.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the CSS</p>
<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#html{
    width: 80%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    left: 10px;
    border: 2px solid red;
    overflow: hidden;
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    height: 80%;
    margin: 4px;
}

#htmlWrap{
    border: 5px solid black;
    position: absolute;
    top: 150px;
    margin-left: 340px;
    width: calc(100% - 360px);
    height: calc(100% - 180px);
    overflow-y: scroll;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
</code></pre>
<p>here is the javascript</p>
<pre><code>    $(&quot;#html&quot;).draggable({cursor:&quot;move&quot;, containment: &quot;#htmlWrap&quot;});
    $(&quot;#html&quot;).resizable({handles: &quot;n,s,e,w&quot;});
});
</code></pre>
<p>and if the links I used would be helpful</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I don't have the first clue why this is not working as I followed the instructions as closely as I could and tried to debug it for a long time. Knowing me I probably made a simple mistake but again, I think that the styling that I applied to it might play a role in the underlying problem.</p>
<p>And again thank you for reading my question!</p>

<p>I need to calculate the number of lines for each text block and check if it's a 4 or a 5 block lines, so what I was thinking was to calculate the occurrence of the 1st word of each block (&quot;LIVE&quot;) and then add an if statement to sort blocks between the 2 categories (4 lines blocks &amp; 5 lines blocks)</p>
<p>The if statement part isn't difficult but I simply don't know how to do the first part, maybe a readlines then when a line has the keyword &quot;LIVE&quot;, add the lines position (with the data sample provided that would be line 1, line 5, line 9, line 14, here we can clearly see that the first 2 blocks are 4 lines but the 3rd one is 5 lines) and then if statement part to sort them out</p>

Puppeteer cannot find Xpath,"<p>I am trying to get into web scraping and I got my hands on a website that looked quite easy to <strong>scrape</strong>. However, this website has many elements with the same ID, which makes it difficult to use selectors.</p>
<p>I am thus trying to get an element using its full XPath. The problem is that when I open the Chrome console on the website and type :</p>
<p><code>$x(&quot;/html/body/div[2]/div[4]/div/table[2]/tbody/tr/td[1]/div[1]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]&quot;)</code></p>
<p>It sometimes work, and sometimes does not. I noticed that it works especially after inspecting the element. I found on other threads that it may be related to the iframe, but the chrome console's iframe selection doesn't seem to change when it works or doesn't work.</p>
<p>Using Puppeteer, this expression ALWAYS returns an empty element. Here is an extract of my code :</p>
<pre><code>const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const URL = &quot;https://www.soccerstats.com/results.asp?league=england_2019&amp;pmtype=bygameweek&quot;;
let browser = await puppeteer.launch(properties);

let page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto(URL, {timeout: 60000, waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'}).then(() =&gt; {
    console.log('success')
});

let match_xpath = &quot;/html/body/div[2]/div[4]/div/table[2]/tbody/tr/td[1]/div[1]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]&quot;;
await page.waitForXPath(match_xpath);

                    return el.innerHTML
           }, match);
console.log(info) //This always returns 'undefined'

<p>Why is it behaving this way ? How can I get the actual content of the element ?</p>

<pre><code>questions = SITE.fetch('questions',tagged='python',fromdate=from_date, todate=today,filter='withbody')
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error 400, 'bad_parameter'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on fromdate. However, when I remove the API_Key and run the above command, it works fine. Could anyone guide me where am I making mistake step?</p>

storing and updating scraped data in database,"<p>Beginner - PHP - Scraping - Databases - Design question ahead:</p>
<p>I built a PHP script that scrapes (using curl) articles off a website, I styled it and added html tags so its presentable and uploaded it to a shared hosting through cPanel.</p>
<p>The scraping is done using php functions curl and preg_match_all. Every page scraped has 17 articles, and so if I scrape 100 pages its 170 articles. I'm scraping only the article headline, url, article summary and date published, so not so much info per article (not the content).</p>
<p>My website presents the article headline (which links to the original source), and article summary.
I also uses the article published date as a string I extract which I parse and show the articles in monthly blocks (December 2019, November 2019, .. and so forth).</p>
<p>Loading time of the website is terrible. Every time you open the website, the script scrapes 100 pages and it takes a lot of time. Even when decreasing the amount of pages to scrape to 30 it takes a long time to load.</p>
<p>Now, the issue I'm dealing with, as inexperienced developer is how to go about designing a solution for this that I can implement in the end in my shared hosting (which differs from VPS in the amount of control I have..)</p>
<p>First thought that came to my mind, is that I should store the scraped data in a mysql database, and update it regularly (with a cron job?), would that work, is it a feasible solution that is easy to implement?</p>
<p>What is the right design flow for a solution that a beginner can/should implement here?</p>
<p>Would it be something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scrape the data first time and store in database.</li>
<li>write a script that once a day (or more) collects new articles from only the first page without creating duplicates (probably need to compare headlines strings with the last DB input until something like headlineString1 == headlineString2, and then stop inserting into the DB).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your thoughts and suggestions would be highly appreciated.
BTW, I'm also trying to redo the website more professionally in Laravel currently.</p>

Histogram Data Visualization in Python (using matplotlib),"<p>I'm pretty new to StackOverflow.

Laravel Raw SQL Queries with named bindings for multiple occurences,"<p>I am using DB facade and select method to run raw SQL queries with bindings. Just need to know can we do have multiple parameters with the same name in the query and replace that by providing only 1 binding with parameter name.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code> $sql = ""SELECT students.id, students.name FROM students 
                where students.student_id = :student_id 
                where added_on = ( SELECT MAX( added_on ) AS newdate

    return DB::select($sql, [
        'student_id' =&gt; 1
    ]);
</code></pre>

<p>note: it might possible that I do not have to use student_id twice in this query. It just an example.
The purpose is to know if we can achieve this.</p>

Pycharm behaving strange with Git (Filename in tree entry contains backslash),"<p>I just got a new laptop and wanted to clone my universities git repository with <code>pycharm</code>. </p>

<p>Whenever I try to clone the repository, using either Git bash/GUI or Pycharm, it fails with the error,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Filename in tree entry contains backslash: 'Aufgabe4a.py# coding=utf-8
  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Within the error is the complete content of the mentioned file.</em></p>

<p>As this is the repo of my university, I can't just go and rename files that are not mine.
<strong>The weird thing is, this doesn't happen on my desktop</strong>. I can clone the repo just fine on there. </p>

<ul>
<li>Both machines are running Windows 10 and the latest versions of Git/Pycharm.</li>
<li>SSH is configured properly and I can't clone using HTTPS either.</li>
</ul>

<p>I look forward to your suggestions, as I need this repo to hand in my exercises and don't always have access to my desktop.</p>

<p>Edit: There is not a single file in the repository containing a backslash in its name. I checked through the website and “working copy“, an iOS app to preview Git repos.</p>

<p>These are the results when debugging with Git on the laptop:</p>

Is there a Perl strict symbol resolution syntax for functions?,"<p>I want to know how to force the resolution of subs at compile time.</p>
<p>For some background, with perl, I can resolve package symbols strictly at compile-time using a <code>::</code> affixed to the end of the package name. For example.</p>
<pre><code>perl -wE'use warnings FATAL =&gt; &quot;bareword&quot;; die 7; Foo::; die 42'
Bareword &quot;Foo::&quot; refers to nonexistent package at -e line 1.
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice in the above code, we didn't die with 7 or 42. We died before the run-time phase. This only works to resolve the package name. I can use a method resolution operator (<code>-&gt;</code>) with the above syntax and resolve a function name in run-time,</p>
<pre><code>perl -E'use warnings FATAL =&gt; &quot;bareword&quot;; die 7; Foo::-&gt;bar(); die 42'
Bareword &quot;Foo::&quot; refers to nonexistent package at -e line 1.
</code></pre>
<p>But this isn't exactly what I want,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If I declare a package <code>Foo</code> <strong>that lacks a sub <code>bar</code></strong> and I want to call the non-existent function <code>bar</code> inside that package, I will no longer get a compile-time error,</p>
<pre><code>  perl -E'package Foo {}; use warnings FATAL =&gt; &quot;bareword&quot;; die 7; Foo::-&gt;bar(); die 42'
  7 at -e line 1.
</code></pre>
<p>You can see here, when <code>()</code> is affixed to the end of the symbol it resolves in run-time; but, when <code>::</code> is affixed to the end of a symbol though it's assumed to be a package name it's resolved in compile-time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>-&gt;</code> operator is using run-time method resolution. It searches <code>@ISA</code>, and also provides a first argument of the class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What I would like is to die if <code>Foo</code> doesn't have <code>bar</code> sub in compile-time.</p>

How to make Inno Setup installer keep temporary files either after installation completes or after VSTO installer completes?,"<p>I have Inno Setup installer (written before me) which extracts a set of VSTO files and starts VSTO MS Office addin installation then. It has a problem that upon extracting VSTO files into a temp folder and launching <code>VSTOInstaller.exe</code> it immediately displays <em>Finish</em> button. If the user clicks it, temporary files are deleted and starting the actual installation of VSTO addin in <code>VSTOInstaller</code> then results in ""file not found"" errors. I'm supposed to fix that (ideally, to have <em>Finish</em> button in Inno Setup installer appear only when <code>VSTOInstaller</code> spawned by it has finished execution).</p>

<p>VSTO package itself (a collection of ""Application Files"" folder, <code>setup.exe</code> and <code>.vsto</code> file) is created by ClickOnce Publish tool in Visual Studio. The package is digitally signed, etc.</p>

<p>I tried various options:</p>

<ul>
<li>To not finish the Inno Setup installation until the process which opens <code>.vsto</code> file finishes (with <code>waituntilterminated</code> flag). Doesn't work, seems the process changes during opening the <code>.vsto</code> file, <code>VSTOInstaller</code> isn't the first process in the chain. Thus, Inno Setup waits only for the process which quickly passes execution to another process (<code>VSTOInstaller</code>) and then shuts down.</li>
<li>To not remove extracted files upon the installation (with <code>uninsneveruninstall</code> flag). Looks like it only works for uninstallation while removing temp files during the installation is somewhat different. I didn't find any way to keep the unpacked files intact after finishing the installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently <code>.iss</code> file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>;---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Setup]
AppName=Outlook Addin
AppVerName=Outlook Addin 2.0
DefaultDirName={tmp}
DefaultGroupName=Outlook Sync Addin
Compression=bzip
Uninstallable=no
OutputBaseFilename=OutlookSetup
VersionInfoVersion=2.0.0.10
UsePreviousAppDir=no
;
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Files]
Source: ""SourcesForExe\*""; DestDir: ""{app}""; Attribs: hidden system; Flags: recursesubdirs uninsneveruninstall
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Run]
Filename: ""{app}\OutlookAddin.vsto""; Parameters: ""OVERRIDE=YES""; StatusMsg: ""Extracting Outlook Addin installer...""; Flags: shellexec waituntilterminated
</code></pre>

<p>Originally, the installer run <code>setup.exe</code> rather than <code>OutlookAddin.vsto</code>. This caused <code>setup.exe</code> to launch <code>VSTOInstaller.exe</code> and immediately shut down. I thought changing to <code>OutlookAddin.vsto</code> (and adding <code>shellexec</code> flag) would fix that so that <code>VSTOInstaller.exe</code> would be launched directly by this method but but it didn't work. Turns out <code>.vsto</code> files are opened by <code>vstoee.dll</code> first.</p>

<p>Any idea how to either keep unpacked files (it's not a big deal that they will stay in temp folder) or somehow wait for all child processes spawned during the setup process?</p>

<p>If that matters, Inno Setup is 5.2.3, VSTO is built with Visual Studio 2015. Tested with Outlook 2010 and 2016.</p>

Regex (re2 googlesheets) multiple values in multiline cell,"<p>Getting stuck on how to read and pretty up these values from a multiline cell via arrayformula.</p>
<p>Im using regex as preceding line can vary.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>just formulas please, no custom code</strong></p>
<br/>
The first column looks like a set of these:
```
[config]
name = the_name
texture = blah.dds
cost = 1000
<p>[effect0]
value = 1000
type = ATTR_A</p>
<p>[effect1]
value = 8
type = ATTR_B</p>
<p>[feature0]
name = feature_blah</p>
<p>[components]
0 = comp_one,1</p>
<p>[resources]
res_one = 1
res_five = 1
res_four = 1</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br/&gt;
Where to be useful elsewhere, at minimum it needs each [tag] set ([effect\d], [feature\d], ect) to be in one column each, for example the 'effects' column would look like:

</code></pre>
<p>ATTR_A:1000,ATTR_B:8</p>
<pre><code>
and so on.



Desired output can also be seen in the included spreadsheet


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Here is the example spreadsheet:&lt;/b&gt;

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arMaaT56S_STTvRr2OxCINTyF-VvZ95Pm3mljju8Cxw/edit?usp=sharing


**Current REGEXREPLACE**

Kinda works, finds each 'type' and 'value' great, just cant figure out how to extract just that from the rest, tried capture (and non-capturing) groups before and after but didnt work
</code></pre>
<p>=ARRAYFORMULA(REGEXREPLACE($A3:$A,&quot;[\n.]<em>[effect\d][\n.]</em>(.<em>)\n(.</em>)&quot;,&quot;1:$1 2:$2&quot;))</p>
<pre><code>
**Current SUBSTITUTE + REGEXEXTRACT + REGEXREPLACE**

A different approach entirely, also kinda works, longer form though and left with having to parse the values out of that string, where got stuck again. Idea was to use this to simplify, then regexreplace like above. Getting stuck removing content around the final matches though, and if can do that then above approach is fine too.
</code></pre>
<p>// First ran a substitute
=ARRAYFORMULA(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE($A3:$A,char(10),&quot;;&quot;),&quot;;;&quot;,char(10)))
// Then variation of this (gave up on single line 'effect/d' so broke it up to try and get it working)
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A3:A&lt;&gt;&quot;&quot;,IFERROR(REGEXEXTRACT(A3:A,&quot;(?m)^(?:[effect0]);(.<em>)</em>$&quot;)&amp;&quot;;;&quot;)&amp;&quot;&quot;&amp;IFERROR(REGEXEXTRACT(A3:A,&quot;(?m)^(?:[effect1]);(.<em>)</em>$&quot;)&amp;&quot;;;&quot;)&amp;&quot;&quot;&amp;IFERROR(REGEXEXTRACT(A3:A,&quot;(?m)^(?:[effect2]);(.<em>)</em>$&quot;)&amp;&quot;;;&quot;),&quot;&quot;))
// Then use regexreplace like above
=ARRAYFORMULA(REGEXREPLACE($B3:$B,&quot;value = (.<em>);type = (.</em>);;&quot;,&quot;1:$1 2:$2&quot;))</p>
<pre><code>
**--EDIT--**

Also, as my updated 'Desired Output' sheet shows (see timestamped comment below), bonus kudos if you can also extract just the values of matching 'type's to those extra columns (see spreadsheet). 

All good if you cant though, just realized would need that too for lookups.

**--END OF EDIT--**

&lt;br/&gt;
Ive tried dozens of things, discarding each in turn, had a quick look in version history to grab out two promising attempts and shared them in separate sheets.

One of these also used SUBSTITUTE to simplify input column, im happy for a solution using either RAW or the SUBSTITUTE results.


&lt;br/&gt;
**Potentially Useful links:**

https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax



&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Just some more words:&lt;/b&gt;

I also have looked at dozens of stackoverflow and google support pages, so tried both REGEXEXTRACT and REGEXREPLACE, both promising but missing that final tweak. And i tried dozens of tweaks already on both.


Any help would be great, and hopefully help others in future since examples with spreadsheets are great since every new REGEX seems to be a new adventure ;)

How do I return a string with an object in javascript?,"<p>I'm trying to get this homework finished.  I'm stuck on the second one in which I have to return a string with the value of an object key.  I thought I had it right when I used this syntax for the name key.  However, even though the console.log showed the name, the results displayed that I did it wrong.  So I tried it the conventional way and got yet another error.  I'm stuck as to how they want me to do this.  It shouldn't really matter how I do it as long as it produces the same results, but I guess the school doesn't teach that.</p>

 * @instructions
 * This function takes as its only argument
 * an object containing a `name` property,
 * and return a string that reads `Hello, my name is {name}`,
 * where `{name}` is the name stored in the object.
 * 
 * For example, if we invoke `getName`
 * passing { id: 1, name: 'Leia', email: 'leia@leia.com` } as the argument,
 * the returned value should look like `Hello, my name is Leia`.

<p>The <code>main</code> class of this list is saved in <code>items</code>. From that I want to <strong>scrape</strong> the <code>img</code> tag and then access the <code>title</code> attribute so that I can save all the certifications of the movies in a database i.e R or PG etc. But when I apply loop to the <code>items</code> it gives an error that the <code>items</code> is not subscriptable. I tried list comprehensions, simple for loop, called <code>items</code> elements through a predefined integer array nothing works and still gives the same error. (<code>items</code> is not Null and is subscriptable i.e. is a list). But when I call it with a direct integers it works fine i.e <code>items[0]</code> or <code>items[1]</code> etc, and gives the correct result for each corresponding element in the <code>items</code> list. The error line is below:</p>
<p><code>cert = [item.find(class_ = &quot;absmiddle certimage&quot;)[&quot;title&quot;] for item in items]</code> or
<code>cert = [item.find(&quot;img&quot;,{&quot;class&quot;: &quot;absmiddle certimage&quot;})[&quot;title&quot;] for item in items]</code>
and this is what works fine: <code>cert = items[0].find(class_ = &quot;absmiddle certimage&quot;)[&quot;title&quot;]</code>
Any suggestion will be appreciated.</p>

"cmudict.dict() vs cmudict.entries() (Python3, NLTK)","<p>I see two different approaches to accessing information from the Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary Corpus Reader (<code>cmudict</code>) in <code>NLTK</code> (via <code>Python3</code>) and am having a hard time understanding the difference between them:</p>

<h2>Version 1</h2>

<pre><code>from nltk.corpus import cmudict
pro1 = cmudict.entries()
</code></pre>

<h2>Version 2</h2>

<pre><code>from nltk.corpus import cmudict
pro2 = cmudict.dict()

<p>According to the docs (<a href=""http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/cmudict.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) <code>cmudict.entries()</code> returns ""the cmudict lexicon as a list of entries containing (word, transcriptions) tuples"" whereas <code>cmudict.dict()</code> returns ""the cmudict lexicon as a dictionary, whose keys are lowercase words and whose values are lists of pronunciations"".</p>

<p>However, if the difference between <code>cmudict.entries()</code> and <code>cmudict.dict()</code> is <strong>only</strong> a difference in returned data type (seems to be what the docs are indicating) why does calling <code>len()</code> on the data from each result in two different numbers (example below)?</p>

pro1 = cmudict.entries()
pro2 = cmudict.dict()

output = ' '.join([""entries length is"", str(len(pro1)), ""dict length is"", str(len(pro2))])
print(output)

React problem with react-hook-form and Material-UI,"<p>I am trying to construct a form with a dynamic field (and a switch to show/hide it). I want to use both react-hook-forms (for its great features: (1) automatically populate the data structure in the way I want, without me having to do it manually, and (2) the feature of 'watching' input (i.e. reacting to user actions immediately and reflecting this in a variable). I also want to use material-ui, because I need my app to look really modern. 
According to documentation of react-hook-forms it supports UI libraries, and material-ui is one of them.</p>

<p>But I have a problem. For some kind of inputs, like material-ui's TextField, everything works fine. I can use 'watch' for it, it works perfectly.
But for some others inputs, like Switch or Checkbox, the watch feature doesn't work well. </p>

<p>For example, in this particular test example, the page reacts well when I type something in the TextField (I can see it also in console), the watch displays correct value. But when I click the Switch element, something strange happens. The first time it works OK, my dynamic field appears, var isDog is set to true which is OK. But for the second time even though isDog value is false the code (the conditional rendered field) behave as if it was still true, and the result is that the dynamic field is rendered forever. Like it was cached somewhere or I don't know. What is going on here?</p>

<p>I tried using different 'value' in the code, e.g. ""true"", or place the value attribute in RFHInput itself, rather than in Switch (controlled by FormControlLabel), but nothing helps.</p>

<p>Anyone had the same problem? What is wrong here? Is this a bug?</p>

Overlay SwiftUI view over all other views including sheets,"<p>I have seen discussion about this that involve UIKit but nothing recent that includes SwiftUI.</p>

<p>I have a Master-Detail style app that calls for two floating buttons that should be visible at all times in the app.</p>

<p>Settings Button: When tapped will un-hide another overlay with some toggles
Add Record Button: When tapped will present a sheet via a @State variable, when tapped again will dismiss the sheet.</p>

<p>If I set the buttons as overlays on the NavigationView they get pushed into the background when the sheet it presented. This isn't particularly surprising but it is not the behaviour that is called for in the design.</p>

<p><strong>First Approach - .overlay on NavigationView()</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct ContentView: View {
    @State var addRecordPresented: Bool = false
      var body: some View {

        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                SomeView()
                AnotherView()
                    .sheet(isPresented: $addRecordPresented, onDismiss: {self.addRecordPresented = false}) {AddRecordView()}
            }
            .overlay(NewRecordButton(isOn: $addRecordPresented).onTapGesture{self.addRecordPresented.toggle()}, alignment: .bottomTrailing)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second Approach - overlay as second UIWindow</strong></p>

<p>I then started again and attempted to create a second UIWindow in SceneDelegate which contained a ViewController hosting the SwiftUI view within UIHostingController, however I had no success trying to override in order to allow both the button to be tappable, but for other taps to be passed through to the window behind the overlay window.</p>

<p>Data flow stuff is removed, this is just trying to present a floating tappable circle that will toggle between green and red when tapped, and has a purple square in the main content view that will present a yellow sheet when tapped. The circle correctly floats on top of the sheet however never responds to taps. </p>

<p>In SceneDelegate:</p>

<pre><code>    var window: UIWindow?
    var wimdow2: UIWindow2?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

           (...)


        if let windowScene = scene as? UIWindowScene {
            let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
            window.rootViewController = UIHostingController(rootView: contentView)
            self.window = window

            window.windowLevel = .normal
            window.makeKeyAndVisible()

            let window2 = UIWindow2(windowScene: windowScene)
            window2.rootViewController = OverlayViewController()

            self.window2 = window2
            window2.windowLevel = .normal+1
            window2.isHidden = false
        }
    }


            (...)


        class UIWindow2: UIWindow {

    override func hitTest(_ point: CGPoint, with event: UIEvent?) -&gt; UIView? {

        let hitView = super.hitTest(point, with: event)

        if hitView != self {
            return nil
        }
        return hitView
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>in a ViewController file:</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit
import SwiftUI

class OverlayViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()


        let overlayView = UIHostingController(rootView: NewRecordButton())
        addChild(overlayView)

        overlayView.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.clear
        overlayView.view.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)
        overlayView.view.isUserInteractionEnabled = true

        self.view.addSubview(overlayView.view)
        overlayView.didMove(toParent: self)

    }

}

struct NewRecordButton: View {
    @State var color = false
    var body: some View {
        Circle().foregroundColor(color ? .green : .red).frame(width: 50, height: 50).onTapGesture {
            self.color.toggle()
            print(""tapped circle"")
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Plain vanilla swiftUI view in the main content window:</p>

<pre><code>import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var show: Bool = false
    var body: some View {

        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                Rectangle().frame(width: 100, height: 100).foregroundColor(.purple).onTapGesture {self.show.toggle()}
                Text(""Tap for Yellow"").sheet(isPresented: $show, content: {Color.yellow}
                )
            }
        }
    }

Include with FromSqlRaw and stored procedure in EF Core 3.1,"<p>So here's the deal - I am currently using EF Core 3.1 and let's say I have an entity: </p>

<pre><code>public class Entity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int AnotherEntityId { get; set; }
    public virtual AnotherEntity AnotherEntity { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I access the <code>DbSet&lt;Entity&gt; Entities</code> normal way, I include AnotherEntity like:</p>

<p><code>_context.Entities.Include(e =&gt; e.AnotherEntity)</code> </p>

<p>and this works. Why wouldn't it, right? Then I go with:</p>

<p><code>_context.Entities.FromSqlRaw(""SELECT * FROM Entities"").Include(e =&gt; e.AnotherEntity)</code> </p>

<p>and this also works. Both return me the same collection of objects joined with AnotherEntity. Then I use a stored procedure which consists of the same query <code>SELECT * FROM Entities</code> named spGetEntities:</p>

<p><code>_context.Entities.FromSqlRaw(""spGetEntities"")</code> </p>

<p>guess what? This also works. It gives me the same output but without joined AnotherEntity, obviously. However if I try to add the Include like this:</p>

<p><code>_context.Entities.FromSqlRaw(""spGetEntities"").Include(e =&gt; e.AnotherEntity)</code></p>

<p>I am getting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FromSqlRaw or FromSqlInterpolated was called with non-composable SQL
  and with a query composing over it. Consider calling <code>AsEnumerable</code>
  after the FromSqlRaw or FromSqlInterpolated method to perform the
  composition on the client side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though the output of <code>_context.Entities.FromSqlRaw(""SELECT * FROM Entities"")</code> and <code>_context.Entities.FromSqlRaw(""spGetEntities"")</code>  is identical.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a proof that I can or I can not do this with EF Core 3.1 but if someone could give me any hint of possibility of this approach it would be nice.</p>

<p>Also if there is another way to get joined entities using stored procedure I would probably accept it as the solution of my issue. </p>

Date_Part on SQL Athena - &quot;Function date_part not registered&quot;,"<p>I'm trying to find latest Sunday (just for the sake of the example)</p>
<p>In the link below I have found an explanation how to use a date function called date_part to extract the day of week (for example, for current timestamp) and other parts of the date which might be interesting.</p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_DATE_PART_function.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_DATE_PART_function.html</a></p>
<p>The gist of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for example to find day of week</p>
<p>select date_part(dow, starttime) as dow
from event</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when I try to run something similar on Athena I receive <strong>&quot;function date_part not registered&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>So how can I find the latest Sunday? Or any other day of the week for that matter.</p>

"When Compiling With .RES File with MinGW G++, .RES isn&#39;t Recognized","<p>I've been trying to compile a program that will have an <strong>icon</strong> linked with it, on <strong>Windows</strong>. Based off of my recent research, <em>since I've never done this before</em>, You would make a .RC file with the info of the program, <em>including icons</em>, which you would then use <strong>windres</strong> to turn it into a .RES file, which you would then link when compiling:</p>

<pre><code>g++ program.cpp -o program.exe
</code></pre>

<p>would become</p>

<pre><code>g++ program.cpp program.res -o program.exe
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing this is the right way to do it, but I'm not sure because when I try to compile the program, it gives the error: </p>

<pre><code>program.res: file not recognized: file format not recognized
collect2.exe error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre>

<p>What can I do to fix this? I've seen people say that if you're compiling 32-bit programs, which I believe I am, you can add parameters to turn it into a .RES file that is meant for compiling 32-bit programs. I've tried this but, it gave the exact same issue, so I don't think that that is the problem.</p>

Unable to override MAT_DIALOG_DATA provider using TestBed.overrideProvider in angular test cases,"<p>I am trying to write integration tests for a component in angular using TestBed. there is some data being injected into component for material dialog using <code>@inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA)</code>. I want to test two cases. One is when no data is provided and other one is when some data is provided. But I wanted to configure testing module same way for all cases (in <code>beforeEach</code> method).
So for cases without data being injected I am configuring the module as below:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
          declarations: [
            PostNewComponent
          ].concat(EntryComponents1),
          imports: [TestingModule],
          providers: [
            PostService,
            { provide: MAT_DIALOG_DATA, useValue: {} },
            { provide: MatDialogRef, useValue: { close: (dialogResult: any) =&gt; {}, updateSize: () =&gt; {} }}
          ]
        });

</code></pre>
<p>and then I have a case in which I want to test the passed test data. so I tried the following to override the provider.</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>    TestBed.overrideProvider(MAT_DIALOG_DATA, {useValue : {name: &quot;passedName&quot;}});
</code></pre>
<p>but is doesn't override the provider. I debugged the issue and found that overrideProvider is finally calling following method in core.js</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>        /**
     * Read the `ngInjectableDef` for `type` in a way which is immune to accidentally reading inherited
     * value.
     *
     * @param type A type which may have its own (non-inherited) `ngInjectableDef`.
     */
    function getInjectableDef(type) {
        var def = type[NG_INJECTABLE_DEF];
        // The definition read above may come from a base class. `hasOwnProperty` is not sufficient to
        // distinguish this case, as in older browsers (e.g. IE10) static property inheritance is
        // implemented by copying the properties.
        //
        // Instead, the ngInjectableDef's token is compared to the type, and if they don't match then the
        // property was not defined directly on the type itself, and was likely inherited. The definition
        // is only returned if the type matches the def.token.
        return def &amp;&amp; def.token === type ? def : null;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>and &quot;type&quot; parameter passed to this function in case of <code>MAT_DIALOG_DATA</code> does not contain <code>ngInjectableDef</code> property. I don't have in depth knowledge of angular so can someone explain why is it not working and what exactly this read-only property &quot;<code>ngInjectableDef</code>&quot; is ?</p>

How to make Ink effect fill all the space in a BottomNavigationBarItem,"<p>I'm making a simple Flutter app with a BottomNavigationBar and the label in my BottomNavigationBarItem exceeds the ink effect created when I tap on it . For some reason, it seems to be covering the icon only and not the label as well.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rgtr0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rgtr0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>How can I change this behavior to accommodate the label as well? I would also prefer to have a more rectangular shape for the ink reaction.</p>

    type: BottomNavigationBarType.fixed,

    showUnselectedLabels: true,
    currentIndex: _currentIndex,
    items: const &lt;BottomNavigationBarItem&gt;[
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.home),
        title: Text('Home'),
      ),

        icon: Icon(Icons.collections),

"Using vuex, firestore, and createUserWithEmailAndPassword, how do I create a user profile collection when a user registers?","<p>For the app I'm building, I want my users to have a profile created for them when they register; the profile would contain the user's username, email, and the uid created by firebase authentication.

Custom Property Wrapper that Updates View Swift,"<h2>Xcode 11.3, Swift 5.1.3</h2>

<p>I am trying currently to create a custom property wrapper that allows me to link variables to a Firebase database. When doing this, to make it update the view, I at first tried to use the <code>@ObservedObject @Bar var foo = []</code>. But I get an error that multiple property wrappers are not supported. Next thing I tried to do, which would honestly be ideal, was try to make my custom property wrapper update the view itself upon being changed, just like <code>@State</code> and <code>@ObservedObject</code>. This both avoids needing to go down two layers to access the underlying values and avoid the use of nesting property wrappers. To do this, I checked the SwiftUI documentation and found out that they both implement the <code>DynamicProperty</code> protocol. I tried to use this too but failed because I need to be able to update the view (call <code>update()</code>) from within my Firebase database observers, which I cannot do since <code>.update()</code> is mutating. </p>

<p>Usage example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>struct ContentView: View {

    @DatabaseBackedArray(\.schools, events: .all, actions: [.on(.constructive) { $0.sort { $0.name &lt; $1.name } }])

    var body: some View {
        Text(""School: "").bold() +
            Text(schools.isEmpty ? ""Loading..."" : schools.first!.name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to use this though, the view never updates with the value from Firebase even though I am positive that the <code>.childAdded</code> observer is being called.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of my attempts at fixing this was to store all of these variables in a singleton that itself conforms to <code>ObservableObject</code>. This <em>solution</em> is also ideal as it allows the variables being observed to be shared throughout my application, preventing multiples instances of the same date and allowing for a single source of truth. Unfortunately, this too did not update the view with the fetched value of <code>currentValue</code>.</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>class Session: ObservableObject {

    @DatabaseBackedArray(\.schools, events: .all, actions: [.on(.constructive) { $0.sort { $0.name &lt; $1.name } }])
    var schools: [School] = []

    private init() {
        //Send `objectWillChange` when `schools` property changes
        _schools.objectWillChange.sink {
            self.objectWillChange.send()
        }
    }

    static let current = Session()

How to make prediction with sagemaker on pandas dataframe,"<p>I am using Sagemaker to train and deploy my machine learning model. As regard to prediction, it will be executed by a lambda function as a scheduled job (every hour). The process is as follows:</p>

<li>preprocess, aggregate and create prediction data set </li>
<li>call sagemaker endpoint and make prediction </li>
<li>either save result to s3 or insert to database table</li>
</ol>

my_bucket = resource.Bucket('pred_data') #subsitute this for your s3 bucket name. </p>

How to handle NaN in controlled input element with value of type number,"<p>In the situation like the code snippet below how should I handle <code>NaN</code> where the state type is <code>number</code>.</p>

Stopping NSScrollView at a target content offset?,"<p>In iOS we're able able stop a &quot;fling&quot; with one of the delegate methods on <code>UIScrollView</code> and setting a <code>targetContentOffset</code>.</p>

I've got responsive / live scrolling working on a <code>NSScrollView</code> with a custom <code>NSView</code>, and would like to limit the amount of <code>pages</code> a user can scroll at a time. Right now, a single fling on the track pad takes you to the 20th page or something (due to responsive scrolling), how do I limit this?</p>

These invalid constraints were provided to RenderFlex's layout() function by the following function, which probably computed the invalid constraints in question:

The offending constraints were: BoxConstraints(w=392.7, h=Infinity)

How to get safe area size/padding in Flutter,"<p>I'm using a SafeArea Widget and want to extract the height of the bottom area which is not within the safe area. As recommended in other sources I tried using <code>MediaQuery.of(context).padding</code> but it always returns <code>EdgeInsets.zero</code>. Is there any other way of getting the size of the bottom region which is not within the safe area?</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>I had SafeArea widget's bottom property set to true (<code>bottom: true</code>) which always resulted in <code>EdgeInsets.zero</code>. Setting <code>bottom: false</code> returns the actual SafeArea's bottom padding value.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>Thanks to the comment of Gary Russel I found a solution. The Inbound gateway must be ""split"" into a Inbound/Outbound channel adapter pair. Here is the fully working example:</p>

<pre><code>@SpringBootApplication
@EnableIntegration

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ExampleApp.class, args);

    // Create listener on port 1234
    @Bean
    public AbstractServerConnectionFactory serverConnectionFactory() {
        TcpNetServerConnectionFactory tcpNetServerConnectionFactory = new TcpNetServerConnectionFactory(1234);
        return tcpNetServerConnectionFactory;
    }

    // Inbound channel
    @Bean
    public MessageChannel requestChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    // Outbound channel
    @Bean
    public MessageChannel replyChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    // Inbound channel adapter
    @Bean
    public TcpReceivingChannelAdapter receivingChannelAdapter(AbstractServerConnectionFactory serverConnectionFactory, MessageChannel requestChannel) {
        TcpReceivingChannelAdapter tcpReceivingChannelAdapter = new TcpReceivingChannelAdapter();
        tcpReceivingChannelAdapter.setConnectionFactory(serverConnectionFactory);
        tcpReceivingChannelAdapter.setOutputChannel(requestChannel);
        return tcpReceivingChannelAdapter;
    }

    // Outbound channel adapter
    @Bean
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = ""replyChannel"")
    public TcpSendingMessageHandler tcpSendingMessageHandler(AbstractServerConnectionFactory serverConnectionFactory) {
        TcpSendingMessageHandler tcpSendingMessageHandler = new TcpSendingMessageHandler();
        tcpSendingMessageHandler.setConnectionFactory(serverConnectionFactory);
        return tcpSendingMessageHandler;
    }

    // Send reply for incoming message -&gt; working
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = ""requestChannel"", outputChannel = ""replyChannel"")
    public Message&lt;String&gt; processMessage(Message&lt;String&gt; message) {
        Message&lt;String&gt; reply = MessageBuilder
                .withPayload(""OK"")
                .setHeader(IpHeaders.CONNECTION_ID, message.getHeaders().get(IpHeaders.CONNECTION_ID, String.class))
                .build();
        return reply;
    }

    // Send greeting -&gt; now working
    @Bean
    public ApplicationListener&lt;TcpConnectionEvent&gt; listener(MessageChannel replyChannel) {
        return tcpConnectionEvent -&gt; {
            if (tcpConnectionEvent instanceof TcpConnectionOpenEvent) {
                Message&lt;String&gt; message = MessageBuilder
                        .withPayload(""Hello client"")
                        .setHeader(IpHeaders.CONNECTION_ID, tcpConnectionEvent.getConnectionId())
                        .build();
                replyChannel.send(message);
            }
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the client gets the greeting ""Hello client"" on connection establishment and an ""OK"" as reply on each send message.</p>

Terraform 12 var and string concatenation best practice,"<p>I'm updating from terraform 0.11 to 0.12 and I was wondering what was the ""best practice"" to concatenate string and vars in my <code>.tf</code> files.</p>

<pre><code># V0.11
foo = ""${var.bar}""

# V0.12
foo = var.bar

<p>but how should-I handle this situation ?</p>

<pre><code>foo = ""${var.bar}-a-string""

<p>Shall-I keep this syntax or turn it in something like :</p>

<pre><code>foo = join(""-"", [${var.bar}, ""a"", ""string""])

How to send API requests with Windows Authentication enabled?,"<p>I'm creating an application built with React, where API requests will be sent from <a href=""http://localhost:3000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:3000</a> to a .NET server at <a href=""https://localhost:5000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://localhost:5000</a>. This works when windows authentication is disabled, but when windows authentication is enabled using IIS, any request, return 401 unauthorized.</p>

<p>I've done quite a bit of research and found that I can send a GET request fine by sending the axios request with { withCredentials: true }. If I send a POST request, this would still return 401 unauthorized from the server, unless I make the request a ""simple-request"", by setting the content type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, according to these specifications: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS</a>.</p>

<p>Is there something I need to have in the web config for these requests to work, when windows authentication is enabled? </p>

<p>An answer to a similar question here, does not help me: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47376728/angular-5-post-request-windows-authentication/48413015#48413015"">Angular 5: Post-request &amp; windows authentication</a>, since having both anonymous and windows authentication enabled, will result in the initial GET request to the server, not being able to get the Active Directory username, using windows authentication, since it seems like the Anonymous Authentication takes precedence. </p>

<p>I can make the POST request with the content type set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, but this seems like the wrong way to go about it. Is there some way I can set some setting on the server, so that when windows authentication is enabled, the server at <a href=""https://localhost:5000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://localhost:5000</a> will accept any API request from <a href=""http://localhost:3000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:3000</a> with content type of JSON?</p>

GetMetadata to get the full file directory in Azure Data Factory,"<p>I am working through a use case where I want to load all the folder names that were loaded into an Azure Database into a different ""control"" table, but am having problems with using GetMetadata activity properly. </p>

<p>The purpose of this use case would be to skip all of the older folders (that were already loaded) and only focus on the new folder and get the "".gz"" file and load it into an Azure Database. Oh a high level I thought I would use GetMetadata activity to send all of the folder names to a stored procedure. That stored procedure would then load those folder names with a status of '1' (meaning successful).</p>

<p>That table would then be used in a separate pipeline that is used to load files into a database. I would use a Lookup activity to compare against already loaded folders and if one of them don't match then that would be the folder to get the file from (the source is an S3 bucket).</p>

<p>The folder structure is nested in the YYYY/MM/DD format (ex: 2019/12/27 where each day a new folder is created and a ""gz"" file is placed there).</p>

<p>I created an ADF pipeline using the ""GetMetadata"" activity pointing to the blob storage that has already had the folders loaded into it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EtqG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EtqG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, when I run this pipeline I only get the top three folder names: 2019, 2018, 2017.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EwlB5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EwlB5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Is it possible to to not only get the top level folder name, but go down all the way down to day level? so instead of the output being ""2019"" it would be ""2019/12/26"" and then next one would be ""2019/12/27"" plus all of the months and days from 2017 and 2018. </p>

"Vagrant up causes guest additions to reinstall each time, why?","<p>Ive had to move onto a new laptop running windows 10, so I have installed the latest Virtual box (6) and vagrant (2.2.6). I pulled down my project and ran a vagrant up to build the box and deploy all my work, but there was an issue with guest additions. The box is Centos 7, so after first launch, I carried out a yum update on the box and added vagrant plugins vbguest and hostsupdater to my local vagrant install. I also had to install deltarpms to get the update to work.</p>

<p>However each time I now up or reload the box, it says there is an issue with vbguest tools missing. IT then proceeeds to uninstall the VGA, reinstall the same version and then tell me it hasnt installed properly. However shared folders do appear to work.  Any ideas what I can do to fix this on upload, full output below.</p>

Samsung Messages app opens sms links in WebView which doesn&#39;t permit wordpress login,"<p>I have a wordpress based website and use SMS to send users a link containing a key which will allow them to reset their password in wordpress.  On a Samsung Android phone the SMS is received by the default Samsung Messages app.  The problem is that the app by default (therefore for most of my users) opens the link using a WebView, not the phones full browser, a browser within the Messages app itself.  The user enters a new password which my website saves no problem but when it then logs them in using the following standard wordpress code the login fails and the user remains logged out:</p>

<pre><code>  wp_set_current_user($user_id, $user-&gt;user_login);
  wp_set_auth_cookie($user_id);
  do_action('wp_login', $user-&gt;user_login);
</code></pre>

<p>If then I try to manually log in within the webview it will also fail.  I'm finding very few resources talking about this issue and I'm unsure how best to solve.  I can't find anything that lets you indicate within a url that webview should not be used (not surprisingly but worth a search), or anything even to let me reliably detect the message has been opened in a webview so a 'please copy and paste the sms link' message could be displayed to the user to work around the issue - not ideal but better than them being baffled why they can't log in.  ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] for the webview on a test Samsung phone gives me:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP_USER_AGENT: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; SAMSUNG SM-A510F/A510FXXS8CSF3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) SamsungBrowser/10.2 Chrome/71.0.3578.99 Mobile Safari/537.36
</code></pre>

<p>I assume the issue is being caused because WebView doesn't allow cookies to be stored, thus breaking wordpress login.  Can anyone suggest a good way to workaround the issue?</p>

<p><strong>What have I done so far</strong></p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> In order to solve this last problem I researched and came across <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42341213/difference-between-vcruntime140d-app-dll-and-vcruntime140d-dll/42348911#42348911"">this useful post</a> which also explained the main difference. Although the thing to be noted is that this application will run on Desktop only. </p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> I found this version to download <a href=""https://www.dll-files.com/vcruntime140_app.dll.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vcruntime140_app.dll</a> from which I downloaded the missing library. Unzipped and added to my debug folder as also possible to see from below print screen:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9lN24Sz.png"" alt=""debug-folder""></p>

<p>After that I built and run the application but surprisingly I was getting the same exact error despite missing <code>.dll</code> was manually added to the debug folder.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> I did more research and came across <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23285591/qt-missing-dll-after-deploy"">this</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42341213/difference-between-vcruntime140d-app-dll-and-vcruntime140d-dll/42348911#42348911"">this post</a> and also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42306355/qt5-8-0-missing-vcruntime140d-app-dll"">this one</a>. But all of them together didn't help me figure out how to understand what the problem was.</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> I tried to install this version too <a href=""https://www.dll-files.com/vcruntime140d.dll.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vcruntime140d.dll</a> from the same site at point 2) above, but still the same result. Missing library <code>VCRUNTIME140D_APP.dll was not found</code></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/HpnzYwJ.png"" alt=""error""></p>

<p>Last thing I have to notice is that: I downloaded and tried <strong>vcruntime140_app.dll</strong> then <strong>vcruntime140d.dll</strong> but I am not able to find a <strong>vcruntime140d_app.dll</strong> if it exists.</p>

<p>I don't understand why, despite the library is there as is possible to see also here <code>C:\Users\me\OneDrive\Desktop\build-signalsQML-Desktop_Qt_5_12_0_MSVC2017_64bit-Debug\vcruntime140_app.dll</code> the double click on the executable still give the same error.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing in the right direction for solving this problem.</p>

but all solutions from GitHub ticket comments didn't help.</em></p>
<p>I'm trying to set up <code>CertManager</code> on DigitalOcean as described in this tutorial: <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-on-digitalocean-kubernetes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-on-digitalocean-kubernetes</a>
I didn't get any error but the request from <code>CertManager</code> is waiting in pending state more than 40 hours.</p>
<p>I have successfully configured Ingress with Nginx, then I created a namespace and created <code>CertManager</code> CRDs:</p>

$ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.12.0/cert-manager.yaml

<p>I can see all <code>CertManager</code> pods as expected:</p>

<p>Then I created staging issuer:</p>

I have tried to use the $0.name variable just to see if i could pass anything but i get this error <code>Contextual closure type '() -&gt; Void' expects 0 arguments, but 1 was used in closure body</code> which i think is because the .onTapGesture() method does not have a closure?.</p>

is there a significant speed difference between attributing a boolean to a variable and a string to variable in python?,"<p>I am currently developing a python project where I am concerned with performance because my CPU is always using like 90-98% of its computing capacity.</p>

<p>So I was thinking about what could I change in my code to make it faster, and noticed that I have a string variable which always receives one of two values: </p>

<pre><code>state = ""ok"" 
state = ""notOk""
</code></pre>

<p>Since it only has 2 values, I tought about changing it to a boolean like:</p>

<pre><code>isStateOk = True
isStateOk = False
</code></pre>

<p>Does it make any sense to do that? Is there a big difference, or any difference at all, in the speed of attributing a string to a variable and attributing a boolean to a variable?</p>

<p>I should also mention that I am using this variable in like 30 <strong>if comparisons</strong> in my code, so maybe the <strong>speed of comparison</strong> would be a benefit?</p>

<pre><code>if (state == ""ok) # Original comparison
if (isStateOk)    # New comparison

How do I reset a sum() over () in a SQL Server query?,"<p>I have a derived table that looks like this example: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ifgl3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ifgl3.png"" alt=""tb_data.""></a></p>

<p>I want the results to have and additional summation column, the catch is I need the summation column to reset the working value if the info column value = 'reset'</p>

<p>{select *, (I assume some variation on sum(number) over (partition by id order by date desc)) as summation from tb_data}</p>

<p>and here's what the output should look like:</p>

<p>The actual derived table covers thousands of ids which is why it needs to be partitioned by the id and ordered by date desc and each has a different number of reset points.</p>

"create DTOs, BOs and DAOs for NestJs REST API","<p>I would like to get into creating REST APIs with NestJs and I'm not sure how to setup scalable layer communication objects.</p>

<p>So from the docs on how to <a href=""https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers"" rel=""noreferrer"">get started</a> I come up with a <code>UsersController</code> dealing with the HTTP requests and responses, a <code>UsersService</code> dealing with the logic between the controller and the database accessor and the <code>UsersRepository</code> which is responsible for the database management.</p>

<p>I use the <a href=""https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-typeorm"" rel=""noreferrer"">TypeORM package</a> provided by NestJs so my database model would be</p>

<pre><code>@Entity('User')
export class UserEntity extends BaseEntity {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  id: string;

  @Column({ unique: true })
  username: string;

  @Column()
  passwordHash: string;

  @Column()
  passwordSalt: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but as you might know this model has to be mapped to other models and vice versa because you don't want to send the password information back to the client. I will try to describe my API flow with a simple example:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>

<p>First I have a controller endpoint for <code>GET /users/:id</code> and <code>POST /users</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  @Get(':id')
  findById(@Param() findByIdParamsDTO: FindByIdParamsDTO): Promise&lt;UserDTO&gt; {
    // find user by id and return it
  }

  @Post()
  create(@Body() createUserBodyDTO: CreateUserBodyDTO): Promise&lt;UserDTO&gt; {
    // create a new user and return it
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I setup the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object"" rel=""noreferrer"">DTOs</a> and want to validate the request first. I use the <a href=""https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation"" rel=""noreferrer"">class-validator</a> package provided by NestJs and created a folder called <strong>RequestDTOs</strong>. Finding something by id or deleting something by id via url parameters is reusable so I can put this into a shared folder for other resources like groups, documents, etc.</p>

<pre><code>export class IdParamsDTO {
  @IsUUID()
  id: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The POST request is user specific</p>

<pre><code>export class CreateUserBodyDTO {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  username: string;

  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  password: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the controller input gets validated before executing business logic. For the responses I created a folder called <strong>ResponseDTOs</strong> but currently it only contains the database user without its password information</p>

<pre><code>export interface UserDTO {
  id: string;
  username: string;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Services</strong></p>

<p>The service needs the bundled information from the params and the body.</p>

<pre><code>  public async findById(findByIdBO: FindByIdBO): Promise&lt;UserBO&gt; {
    // ...
  }

  public async create(createBO: CreateBO): Promise&lt;UserBO&gt; {
    // ...
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The GET request only needs the ID, but maybe it's still better to create a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_object"" rel=""noreferrer"">BO</a> because you might want to switch from string IDs to integers later. The ""find by id"" BO is reusable, I moved it to the shared directory</p>

<pre><code>export interface IdBO {
  id: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the user creation I created the folder <strong>RequestBOs</strong></p>

<pre><code>export interface CreateBO {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the <strong>ResponseBOs</strong> the result would be</p>

<pre><code>export interface UserBO {
  id: string;
  username: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and as you will notice this is the same like the <strong>UserDTO</strong>. So one of them seems to be redundant?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Repositories</strong></p>

<p>Lastly I setup the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object"" rel=""noreferrer"">DAOs</a> for the repositories. I could use the auto-generated user repository and would deal with my database model I mentioned above. But then I would have to deal with it within my service business logic. When creating a user I would have to do it within the service and only call the <code>usermodel.save</code> function from the repository.</p>

<p>Otherwise I could create <strong>RequestDAOs</strong></p>

<p>The shared one..</p>

<pre><code>export interface IdDAO {
  id: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the POST DAO</p>

<pre><code>export interface CreateDAO {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that I could create a database user within my repository and map database responses with <strong>ResponseDAOs</strong> but this would always be the whole database user without the password information. Seems to generate a big overhead again.</p>

<hr>

<p>I would like to know if my approach using 3 request and 3 response interfaces is way too much and can be simplified. But I would like to keep a flexible layer because I think those layers should be highly independent... On the other hand there would be a huge amount of models out there.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

How to replicate PromiseKit-style chained async flow using Combine + Swift,"<p>I was using PromiseKit successfully in a project until Xcode 11 betas broke PK v7. In an effort to reduce external dependencies, I decided to scrap PromiseKit. The best replacement for handling chained async code seemed to be Futures using the new Combine framework.</p>
<p>I am struggling to replicate the simple PK syntax using Combine</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Swift standard library implementation of async/await would solve this problem (<em>async/await does not yet exist, despite lots of chatter and involvement from <a href=""https://gist.github.com/lattner/429b9070918248274f25b714dcfc7619"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chris Latter himself</a></em>)</p>

<p>I could replicate using Semaphores (<em>error-prone?</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>flatMap can be used to chain Futures</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The async code I'd like should be able to be called on demand, since it's involved with ensuring user is logged in. I'm wrestling with two conceptual problems.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If I wrap Futures in a method, with <code>sink</code> to handle result, it seems that the method goes out of scope before subscriber is called by <code>sink</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since Futures execute only once, I worry that if I call the method multiple times I'll only get the old, stale, result from the first call. To work around this, maybe I would use a PassthroughSubject? This allows the Publisher to be called on demand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I have to retain every publisher and subscriber outside of the
calling method</li>
<li>How can I replicate simple chained async using the Swift standard library and then embed this in a swift instance method I can call on-demand to restart the chained async calls from the top??</li>

How extract jsonb column in fields by key,"<p>I'm using postgresql and postgis plugin.</p>

<p>I have stored data with this scheme: <code>table_id is primary key, properties is a jsonb and geom as geometry(GeometryZ,4326)</code>;</p>

<p>If I make this request: <code>select table_id, properties, geom from nametable</code> return all info with table_id as integer, properties as jsonb and geom as geometry(GeometryZ,4326).</p>

<p>I would like a query where properties return table_id, a list of column where name of column is the key of value and his value and geom. For example, if properties has name and density return a response like this: <code>table_id | name | density | geom |</code>, but I dont know the name of properties so I think that should be a query inside that query that get name of keys.</p>

<p>The closest I've been to get it, its with this query: <code>select jsonb_object_keys(properties) as key from nametable;</code></p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>First, I have stored a field as jsonb in my postgressql database, so I would like extract that jsonb to columns. But have stored differents tables that contains differents properties into jsonb column.</p>

<p>So, the idea is get a query where select table_id, properties(extracted in multiple columns) and geom.</p>

<p>1 - With this I have the name of keys: <code>select jsonb_object_keys(properties) as key from nametable group by key;</code></p>

<p>2 - With keys get in column all values of each key.</p>

<p>3 - Return a query where when I call it, return me table_id, column of properties extracted from jsonb, geom from nametable;</p>

<p>My problem is that I dont know how generate that query with sub-queries.</p>

Unable to update PATH variable for pip on Windows 10,"<p>I know there are thousands of similar topics but my pip command has suddenly stopped to work and, despite all my researchs, I can't figure out why. It has been a while since I last used pip and surprisingly my computer doesn't recognize the command anymore. I reinstalled pip and the prompt tells me that the PATH variable is not correctly updated. So I update it but that doesn't solve the problem, the prompt still tells me the PATH variable is not updated. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling python and pip and nothing works.
In my environment variables, I have a user variable named PATH and a system variable named PATH, both of them have the value :<br>
<code>C:\Users\mertz\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts\</code></p>

<p>The user variable was already written by itself and I had to write the system variable myself.</p>

<p>When I'm installing pip I get this warning : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WARNING: The scripts pip.exe, pip3.6.exe and pip3.exe are installed in 'C:\Users\mertz\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
    Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when I type pip in the command prompt, it tells me that pip is not recognized.</p>

How to get rid of titlebar without removing icon in taskbar with Tkinter?,"<p>So, I was recently checking out VsCode, and I noticed an interesting feature.

I think this is a very cool feature.</p>
<p>I make a lot of productivity apps with Tkinter*, so I looked at how to do this in my apps. Unfortunately, the standard way to get rid of the titlebar in Tkinter is to disable the Window Manager (using <code>overridedirect(1)</code>). This also gets rid of the taskbar icon, which I want to keep.</p>
<p>In other words, what I am trying to get is

Webpack still including an explicitly excluded folder,"<p>I'm using webpack on a nodeJs repo with the serverless.com framework for deploying to AWS Lambda functions. Since the Lambda container on AWS already contains aws-sdk, I'm attempting to exclude it from packaging.</p>

Role Based Navigation Items,"<p>I'm learning to develop in .NET and Angular and have run into a brick wall when it comes to role based menu items. I have routing setup and active, and users trying to access areas their role does not provide access to are blocked from entering.  This all works.  The issue I'm having is ensuring they don't see the nav links for those areas that they don't have access too.  (If it helps at all, I'm using the CoreUI admin theme as the base for this).</p>

<p>My project has 4 roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>GlobalAdmin </li>
<li>ClientAdmin  </li>
<li>LocationAdmin</li>
<li>ReportsOnly</li>
</ul>

<p>Access is controlled by Core Identity in the .NET application. On the angular side of things I was setting up a role directive used to control the viewing of the nav links using this directive and adding *appHasRole=""['GlobalAdmin']"" for whichever role was required.  This doesn't work though as my sidebar builds my links by grabbing them from the _nav.ts file.  </p>

<p>Is anyone able to help me out with adding this functionality?  I've even tried using seperate _nav files for each role which I know isnt optimal, and quickly discovered if someone has more than one role, both nav bars are displayed.  </p>

<p>This is how my nav system is currently built.  </p>

Using number pipe in input gives Nan angular,"<p>I want to make all numbers to be formatted based on our application language, so I made a pipe, where I pass locale and value.

Embed Unity inside iOS in own ViewController,"<p>Using Unity 2019.3.0f3 and its <code>Unity as a library</code> feature I'm trying to embed a Unity project inside my iOS application.</p>

<p>Unity officially only supports full screen rendering. Nevertheless I'm looking for a way around that restriction.<br>
In previous versions of Unity i successfully used <a href=""https://github.com/jiulongw/swift-unity"" rel=""noreferrer"">swift-unity</a> to do the integration. Within this approach it is easy to just get the View where Unity is rendering to (using <code>UnityGetGLView()</code>). I had no problems regarding stability or resources.</p>

<p>Using the new library approach, every time I try to access the <code>UnityView</code>, unity forces it's complete <code>Window</code> as <code>keyWindow</code>. </p>

<p>I tried accessing the UnityView in my own ViewController using </p>

<pre><code>if let unityView = UnityFramework.getInstance()?.appController()?.rootViewController.view {
    // insert subview at index 0 ensures unity view is behind current UI view
    view?.insertSubview(unityView, at: 0)
}

<p>But that immediately activates the complete unity-window and hides my parenting <code>UITabBarController</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to make the <code>UnityFramework.getInstance()?.appController()?.rootViewController</code> a child of my <code>UITabBarController</code> failed with the same result.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is not possible to add a child <code>ViewController</code>. Only adding subviews seems possible.</p>

<p>Does anybody know where that window-behaviour is located or how i can access the <code>UnityView</code> (or the RootViewController) and use it freely?</p>

SAML Single Logout using Sustainsys and Azure giving Message is invalid error,"<p>Details: </p>

<p>I have a custom service provider with Azure AD as our identity provider. I have been able to achieve Single Sign On. The problem arises when attempting global Single Logout. I construct the Logout Request and send it as follows : </p>

<pre><code>CommandResult commandResult = CommandFactory.GetCommand(CommandFactory.LogoutCommandName).Run(requestData, Options);

var responseWrapper = new HttpResponseWrapper(HttpResponse);
commandResult.ApplyCookies(responseWrapper);

commandResult.Apply(responseWrapper);
</code></pre>

<p>Following error pops up on Azure: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry, but we’re having trouble signing you in.</p>
  
  <p>AADSTS20012: An error occurred when we tried to process a
  WS-Federation message. The message was invalid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon refreshing the page, Azure says they have successfully logged me out. On the service provider side, I see my initial Logout Request with signature and x509 certificate. After the refresh, Azure sends a SAML Logout request (instead of a logout response) back to the LogoutURL. </p>

<p>SAML Config: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;sustainsys.saml2 entityId=""serviceProviderURL.net"" 
                      publicOrigin=""serviceProviderURL.net/Resource""

&lt;/sustainsys.saml2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Signing certificate is always null unless I added a service certificate. I add the service certificate for the identity provider which has the signing certificate I get from Azure for this SSO enterprise application. I have also uploaded the service provider .pfx file to the same enterprise Application. 
Following is my code to add the pfx and certificate. </p>

<pre><code>        try

            options.IdentityProviders.Default.SigningKeys.AddConfiguredKey(X509Cert);

Handling errors with react-apollo useMutation hook,"<p>I have been trying to get my head around this problem but haven't found a strong answer to it. I am trying to execute a login mutation using the useMutation hook. </p>

<p><strong><em>TLDR; I want to know what exactly is the difference between the onError passed in options and error given to me by the useMutation</em></strong></p>

<p>Here's my code snippet</p>

<pre><code>const [login, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(LOGIN_QUERY, {
        variables: {
            email,
            password
        },
        onError(err) {
            console.log(err);
        },
});

</code></pre>

<p>On the server-side, I have a preset/hardcoded email used for login and I am not using Apollo or any other client. In the resolver of this Login Mutation, I simply throw an error if the email is not same using </p>

<pre><code>throw new Error('Invalid Email');
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to handle this error on the client-side (React). But my concern is that if I use the 'error' returned from the useMutation hook and try to show the error in this way</p>

<pre><code>render() {
...
{error &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt; Error occured &lt;/div&gt;}
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>the error is updated in the UI but then immediately React shows me a screen with Unhandled Rejection (Error): Graphql error: My-custom-error-message</p>

<p>But, if I use onError passed in options to useMutate function, then it doesn't show me this screen and I can do whatever I want with the error.</p>

<p>I want to know what exactly is the difference between the onError passed in options and error given to me by the useMutation and why does React show me that error screen when onError is <strong>not</strong> used.</p>

where to put scraper logic in Laravel?,"<p>I want to regularly (once a day) <strong>scrape</strong> data and insert into the database table which I want to completely clear before each insertion of the scraped data. Which in turn I want to present with my presentation logic.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to structure this.</p>
<p>For the presentation logic I guess it's simple, I make a request to a controller to get all data from the DB, and then I just present it with views.</p>
<p>For the <strong>scraper</strong> logic, I'm not so sure..
Since I want to regularly <strong>scrape</strong> (cron job?), I heard about Laravel scheduler, from a tutorial I saw, the logic was put into a command file.. so that's where I should put my php script for the scheduler to run?</p>
<p>Or do I need to create a model and put the logic there, use a controller to insert it into the DB?
If so, how do I schedule it as a cron job?</p>

Pass pan gesture through to default camera controller if hit test fails,"<p>I have a SceneKit <code>SCNView</code> to which I wish to attach a pan gesture recognizer. This performs a <code>hitTest</code> to work out if the user has touched a particular object in my scene. However, if this hit test fails (the user <em>hasn't</em> touched anything in particular) then I want to pass that touch through to the default camera controller.</p>

<p>At present, adding my own pan gesture recognizer seems to override the default camera controller and prevent it from working.</p>

<pre><code>let scnView = SCNView()
// Configure scnView with my geometry etc
// ...

let panGesture = UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: context.coordinator,

extract json string values in a panda column into a new columns with dynamic key in the first level,"<p>Hi I have a very large dataset in csv file, which I read into a panda dataframe. One column has json strings that I want to extract the values into new columns. The pic below shows a few rows in my csv file. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dMEch.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dMEch.png"" alt=""this is example of my csv datafile.""></a></p>

<p>The fourth column (data) is the one required to be extracted. The key in the first level (605,254,834,265 etc) is always changing but the number is always the same as that in the last column ('reg'). I want to extract the values of 'price', 'status' and '#result' and put them in new columns.</p>

<p>The code I am using is</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import json
from pandas import DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('sample.csv')
df[""result""]=np.nan #create empty column
df[""price""]=np.nan
df[""status""]=np.nan
for i in range (0,len(df['data'])):
      df['result'].iloc[i]=json.loads(df['data'].iloc[i])[str(df['reg'].iloc[i])]['#result']
      df['price'].iloc[i]=json.loads(df['data'].iloc[i])[str(df['reg'].iloc[i])]['price']
      df['status'].iloc[i]=json.loads(df['data'].iloc[i])[str(df['reg'].iloc[i])]['status']

print(df)
</code></pre>

<p>So I got the dataframe with new columns (result, price and status) as below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r727H.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r727H.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The code gives me the output that I want. However since i am using 'for loop' it takes very long to run for the big dataframe. I think there must be a more clever way doing this. And I know that there are different ways to do if the first level key is constant. Can anyone have a better idea to extract this type of json strings in panda frame. 
Cheers!</p>

Reading Data from AWS S3,"<p>I have some data with very particular format (e.g., tdms files generated by NI systems) and I stored them in a S3 bucket. Typically, for reading this data in python if the data was stored in my local computer, I would use npTDMS package. But, how should is read this tdms files when they are stored in a S3 bucket? One solution is to download the data for instance to the EC2 instance and then use npTDMS package for reading the data into python. But it does not seem to be a perfect solution. Is there any way that I can read the data similar to reading CSV files from S3? </p>

When player's Playing state is changed <code>(isPlaying == true)</code>, the <code>viewModel</code> in <code>SongListView</code> resets and becomes empty array. Due to which, the list on my view becomes empty. </p>

Set starting route in a visual studio blazor project,"<p>I'm working on a server side 3.0.100 blazor project in VS2019. </p>

<p>I have several pages.  I would like it if while I was debugging i could start a non-default route/page for debugging purposes.  </p>

<p>What I've tried on the project properties debug tab:</p>

<p>1) Setting the Launch browser relative path.  If i set this, to say ""equipmentlist"", the app starts at localhost:44325/equipmentlist but displays the root route.  If i then navigate to the equipmentlist page, the url changes to localhost:44325/equipmentlist/equipmentlist and the correct content displays.</p>

<p>2) Setting the App URL: this has the same behavior as 1</p>

<p>I'd like to save myself extra clicks every time i click debug.</p>

<p>Edit:
The ""Launch browser"" setting changes the address that displays when the browser launches, but the content displayed is still the default route.</p>

<p>i.e.  localhost:44325/equipmentlist/ is displayed in the browser address bar but it still shows the content from the ""/"" page.  I have to navigate to localhost:44325/equipmentlist/equipmentlist to see the content required.</p>

android room suspend insert success but does not return id,"<p>I'm trying to use room database with suspend keyword.</p>

<p>I can <strong>successfully insert a data</strong> into database. But after that, the <strong>insert method will not return anything</strong>, that means I can't do anything after insertion such as insert another data by the returned id.</p>

<pre><code>@Dao
interface EventDao {
    ...

    @Insert
    suspend fun insert(event: Event): Long

    ...
}

    suspend fun insertEvent(event: Event, personId: Long) {
        val id = eventDao.insertSync(event)

        // !!! FREEZE - the code below here will never reach !!!

        val attendee = EventAttendee(
            personId = personId,
            eventId = id

        eventAttendeeDao.insert(attendee)

<p>Actually, if I remove <code>suspend</code> keyword, I can get the return id properly. The freezing problem will only happen when I use suspend keyword in front of insertion method in Dao class.</p>

<p>Logcat doesn't show any logs of this, and the app doesn't crash, so I have no idea what happened.</p>

How can I create the first IAM role to assume with Terraform?,"<p>I'm trying to set up AWS with Terraform and confused about <a href=""https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_role_policy_attachment.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aws_iam_role</a>.</p>

<p>So to create a first role(let say poweruser), <code>aws_iam_role</code> requires <code>assume_role_policy</code>, which is a role arn to assume. (But there is no poweruser role with poweruser policy yet.)</p>

<p>It feels like I'm in chicken and egg situation - to create a role, I need another role to assume, but can't create since I don't have a role to assume yet.</p>

My check for whether a graph is a Binary Tree always returns false,"<p>I have this question that is medium level and couldn't even think on how to solve this problem, my solution could be overkill as I have no idea on how to traverse a bunch of numbers in an array to check whether it is a binary tree or not. The program always returns false no matter what</p>

<p>If you have a better answer to the question that would be perfect</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have the function <code>TreeConstructor(strArr)</code> take the array of strings stored in <code>strArr</code>, which will contain pairs of integers in the following format (i1, i2) where i1 represents a child a node in a tree and the second integer i2 signifies that it is the parent of i1. For example if <code>strArr</code> is <code>[""(1,2)"", ""(2,4)"", ""(7,2)""]</code> </p>

<pre><code>    4 
   /
  2
 / \
1   7
</code></pre>
  
  <p>which you can see forms a proper binary tree. Your program should, in this case, return the string true because a valid binary tree can be formed. If a proper binary cannot be formed with the integer pairs, then return the string false. All of the integers within the tree will be unique, which means there can only be one node in the tree with the given integer value</p>
  
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<pre><code>input: [""(1,2)"", ""(2,4)"", ""(5,7)"", ""(7,2)"", ""(9,5)""]
output: true

            logging.error('Failure: Unable to reach websb! ==&gt; '+ str(driver.find_element_by_xpath('//span[@jsselect=""heading"" and @jsvalues="".innerHTML:msg""]').text))

            return

        elif hw.is_websiteReachable():
            logging.info(""Success: website is reachable!"")

            curr.execute(""""""INSERT INTO db_name(logs) VALUES (%s)"""""", (""Success: website is reachable!""))

How to catch ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID in javascript,"<p>The Web Application I am developing needs to fetch data from a number of different IOTs within the local network, e.g., </p>

<pre><code>const response = await fetch(""https://192.168.0.245/api/auto/login"", options);
</code></pre>

<p>Since it is an https connection, and each IOT carries a self-signed SSL cert, therefore, the fetch() above will throw an error ""TypeError: Failed to fetch"" (since the cert has not yet been accepted), and the application will show the following in the browser's console</p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS https://192.168.0.245/api/auto/login net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID
</code></pre>

<p>What I need is to be able to catch this error in javascript. Specifically I need to be able to catch different errors like ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID, ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR or ERR_CONNECITON_REFUSED... etc. so I can show different error messages accordingly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the fetch() function always throw the same ""TypeError: Failed to fetch"" exception under all these three different errors above.</p>

<p>Is there anyway I can catch this specific ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID exception?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

How to Configure HTML body for ms-outlook://compose body parameter for Outlook for iOS,"<p><strong>UPDATE - 2/26/2020</strong>
One of our clients just got this back from Microsoft:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for submitting this issue to the Outlook for iOS and Android team. After careful consideration, the product team is maintaining it's decision to disable HTML within Outlook Mobile deeplinks. While HTML within deeplinks was previously allowed, support for this scenario was never formally designed or introduced. Additionally, supporting HTML within deeplinks can introduce unintended consequences and potential security issues.</p>
  
  <p>Though not officially supported, deeplinks that utilize plain-text will continue to work in Outlook for iOS and Android. Please note that this behavior may be modified at any time without notice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the <code>UIActivityViewController</code> to share your HTML body also no longer works. It would appear that Microsoft has taken away our ability to generate any HTML bodies when composing an email in their system.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE - 2/6/2020</strong>
As responses show, it's gone from fixed to broken again. One of our large custom app clients that uses outlook exclusively has been pursuing a ticket with MS and this week finally got a response that multiple companies have reported on this issue and they are looking into a way to securely allow sharing of HTML bodies. In the interim for iOS apps we've been converting our code to use the <code>UIActivityViewController</code> and excluding almost all the <code>activityTypes</code>. This allows you to set the HTML body:</p>

<pre><code>let items = [[""Body"" : emailBody]]

let acv = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: items, 
                           applicationActivities: nil)
</code></pre>

<p>The two issues with this approach, is
a) If you try and set the subject or recipients, those are ignored. I've tried multiple different ways with no success. So in the case of our apps where for reporting purposes we collect the contact info before the email is sent, the user is required to again enter the contact info in the Outlook message composer.
b) It adds an extra step of requiring the user to select Outlook as the share item from the Initial <code>UIActivityViewController</code>. We've had to deal with reported ""bugs"" that are not bugs, just users not selecting Outlook.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE - 12/12/2019</strong>
The issue appears to have been fixed by Microsoft as my Outlook version remains 4.15.0 but when asked today to make screens shots for a ticket I submitted, the links are now being encoded correctly again. Please vote to close.</p>

<p><em>Original Question/Issue</em></p>

<p>I was previously using instructions based on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/35462621/879231"">this post</a>. But it appears that with Outlook for iOS version 4.14.x and up (Outlook version tested as of this post 4.15.0) the encoded HTML body is being stripped of all of its encoded characters. Which is to say that something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=""www.somelink.com""&gt;Some Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes</p>

<pre><code>braref=www.somelink.comSomeLink/abr
</code></pre>

<p>Hoping someone from the iOS Outlook team sees this post and can perhaps provide some guidance on how one might configure an HTML body to be passed through the <code>ms-outlook://compose</code> <code>body</code> parameter. Or if anyone else has figured it out. Please respond. 
Thanks!</p>
