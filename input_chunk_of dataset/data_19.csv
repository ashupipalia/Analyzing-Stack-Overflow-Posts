SwiftUI: Prevent Image() from expanding view rect outside of screen bounds,"<h3>What I'm trying to achieve</h3>

<p>I'm trying to create a SwiftUI view where an image should expand the entire screen (<code>edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)</code>), and then overlay a view on top of that, that also fills the entire screen, but respects the safe area.</p>

<h3>What I've tried</h3>

<p>This is my code, which comes close:</p>

<pre><code>struct Overlay: View {
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      HStack {
        EmptyView()
        Spacer()
        Text(""My top/right aligned view."")
          .padding()
          .background(Color.red)
      }
      Spacer()
      HStack {
        Text(""My bottom view"")
          .padding()
          .background(Color.pink)
      }
    }
  }
}

struct Overlay_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    ZStack {
      Image(uiImage: UIImage(named: ""background"")!)
        .resizable()
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
      Overlay()
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>The issue and tested solutions</h3>

<p>The issue is that the image is not clipped it looks like, so it expands the parent view to a width larger than the screen width, which then makes the top right aligned red text box float off screen (see image).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVlhM.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVlhM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I tried using <code>.clipped()</code> in various places, with no luck. I would preferably avoid using <code>GeometryReader</code> if possible.</p>

<h3>Q: How can I make the image view only fill the screen?</h3>

Heroku CI with Postgres postgis extension,"<p>I'm using a <code>postgis</code> extension to my database on Heroku. In production this works just fine; I'm mapping like a boss.</p>

<li>How can I create extensions in HerokuCI?</li>
<li>Is postgis an allowable extension at all in HerokuCI?</li>

Why does SQLITE create empty sqlite_sequence table?,"<p>I have a database of several tables in which the first field is defined as:</p>

<p>'ID' INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE ... PRIMARY_KEY('ID')</p>

<p>I do not use the AUTOINCREMENT keyword for any of these tables yet my db contains an empty sqlite_sequence table which I cannot delete. Inserting records into these tables with a NULL value for the ID field generates default incremental values for the ID fields but does not populate or update the sqlite_sequence table. Is there any way I can reset the last inserted rowid value to 0 for these tables?</p>

CPU usage gets higher as more WebRTC peers are added?,"<p>I'm streaming video/audio from a server with an electron app to get the desktop. When one user is connected CPU usage on both cores is 30-50%.

<p>It's like it's encoding the video for each user that joins? How can I make it encode once and send that stream to everyone?

Can You Consistently Keep Track of Column Labels Using Sklearn&#39;s Transformer API?,"<p>This seems like a very important issue for this library, and so far I don't see a decisive answer, although it seems like for the most part, the answer is 'No.'</p>

<p>Right now, any method that uses the <code>transformer</code> api in <code>sklearn</code> returns a <code>numpy</code> array as its results.  Usually this is fine, but if you're chaining together a multi-step process that expands or reduces the number of columns, not having a clean way to track how they relate to the original column labels makes it difficult to use this section of the library to its fullest.</p>

<p>As an example, here's a snippet that I just recently used, where the inability to map new columns to the ones originally in the dataset was a big drawback:</p>

<pre><code>numeric_columns = train.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()
cat_columns     = train.select_dtypes(include=np.object).columns.tolist()

numeric_pipeline = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(strategy='median'), StandardScaler())
cat_pipeline     = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent'), OneHotEncoder())

transformers = [
('num', numeric_pipeline, numeric_columns),
('cat', cat_pipeline, cat_columns)
]

combined_pipe = ColumnTransformer(transformers)

train_clean = combined_pipe.fit_transform(train)

test_clean  = combined_pipe.transform(test)
</code></pre>

<p>In this example I split up my dataset using the <code>ColumnTransformer</code> and then added additional columns using the <code>OneHotEncoder</code>, so my arrangement of columns is not the same as what I started out with.  </p>

<p>I could easily have different arrangements if I used different modules that use the same API.  <code>OrdinalEncoer</code>, <code>select_k_best</code>, etc.  </p>

<p>If you're doing multi-step transformations, is there a way to consistently see how your new columns relate to your original dataset?</p>

<p>There's an extensive discussion about it <a href=""https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5523"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, but I don't think anything has been finalized yet.</p>

How to add VAT in Stripe Checkout?,"<p>I'm using Stripe Checkout to create a subscription in Stripe Billing. Checkout also auto creates the Stripe customer object.</p>

<p>How can I add right right VAT rate based on where the customer is based? The customer should be able to see the price both including and excluding VAT/GST both in the checkout session itself and on the invoice.</p>

<p>This works fine so far. But now, I have a few other tests for whom I want to share across them a single <code>my_app</code> instance . So, I created a new <code>shared_app</code> fixture with class scope that ideally would take a single <code>my_app</code> instance and share it at the class level like in the following code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>@pytest.fixture(scope='class')
def shared_app(my_app):
    yield my_app

class InterestingTest(object):

<p>But this results in the following <strong>error</strong>: <code>ScopeMismatch: You tried to access the 'function' scoped fixture 'shared_app' with a 'class' scoped request object, involved factories</code></p>

<p>I also tried moving the fixture to the class, e.g.:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>
class InterestingTest(object):
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True, scope='class')

    def test_other_shared_app():
       ...
</code></pre>

<p>and it gives the same error. And similarly, removing <code>scope='class'</code>, then the fixture doesn't ever seem to be called. Adding <code>shared_app</code> explicitly to the tests, then <code>shared_app</code> is not actually shared, but is created for each test.</p>

<p>So, how can I share a <code>function</code> fixture among a few tests in a class?</p>

How to integrate SwiftLint with an iOS app using Swift Package Manager?,"<p>I'm creating a new iOS app in Xcode 11 (beta 5) and I'd like to try using Swift Package Manager instead of CocoaPods for managing dependencies. </p>

<p>A common pattern when using SwiftLint and CocoaPods is to add SwiftLint as a dependency and then add a build phase to execute <code>${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftLint/swiftlint</code>; this way all developers end up using the same version of SwiftLint.</p>

What causes GLSL recompilation of vertex shader based on state?,"<p>I am using the <strong>GL_ARB_debug_output</strong> extension. The driver gives me this warning:</p>

<p><strong><em>Program/shader state performance warning: Vertex shader in program 16 is being recompiled based on GL state.</em></strong></p>

<p>So, I tried setting various GL state before I compile my shader, including:</p>

<p><strong>GL_BLEND</strong>,
<strong>GL_CULL_FACE</strong>,
<strong>GL_DEPTH_TEST</strong>,
the polygon-offset,
and the blendfunc.</p>

<p>But it still recompiles upon first draw.</p>

<p>What are the typical pieces of state that could cause the driver to recompile a vertex shader?</p>

Extending Components in rebass.js?,"<p>Beginner here. As of now I can use <code>Box</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Box
  p={5}
  fontSize={4}
  width={[ 1, 1, 1/2 ]}
  color='white'
  bg='magenta'&gt;
  Box
&lt;/Box&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and give it certain specified props, <a href=""https://rebassjs.org/Box"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as it says on the site</a>:</p>

<pre><code>All margin and padding props
width: responsive width
fontSize: responsive font size
color: text color
bg: background color
flex: CSS flex shorthand property
order: CSS order property
alignSelf: CSS align-self property
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What if I need more props? </p>

<p>I know that I can <a href=""https://rebassjs.org/extending"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extend rebass components</a>, however, this seems to hard-code certain CSS properties into the component. E.g. If my Box is always purple I can create <code>PurpleBox</code> and save the color there. Or on their website there is this example:</p>

<pre><code>const Container = props =&gt;
  &lt;Box
    {...props}
    mx='auto'
    css={{
      maxWidth: '1024px'
    }}

jar resources in jnlp are not signed by same certificate ETRADE Pro app Kubuntu 18.04,"<p>I've been scouring the net for an answer and the majority of the results require resigning the JAR files. The thing is I have no idea where they are located or even if I have any. <em>The error states that the JAR resources are IN the JNLP file</em> so I'm not really sure how that works. </p>

<p>This problem just started yesterday so it has to be a certificate that was added somehow onto my system that java is using to sign the jars in the JNLP file. Would deleted all certificates be a good idea? </p>

<p>The problem is that I'm not sure how to find them or delete them. I was able to open the Java Control Panel for java and I could see a list of certificates but it would not let me delete them. I did, however, delete the java cache but that did not fix the problem.</p>

<p>I noticed in my update center there is an Opera browser certificate. It wasn't there before and wondering now if somehow that is involved? This is a really messy situation I'm in and really need a fix as I use Etrade for my livelihood.</p>

<p>This problem started yesterday and I've done nothing to my computer except install Opera web browser. My Etrade was working perfectly for a long time able to launch with no problems so I can't figure out why all of a sudden it gave me that error.
I tried completely removing java <strong>JDK 8u212</strong> verified it wasn't on my system then did a clean manual install of JDK 8u221. It was installed correctly with no problems so it's been really frustrating seeing the problem still there. </p>

<p>Are there residual files or these ""certificates"" left over on my system? How can I check which JAR resources are not signed by the same certificate and then sign them with the same one? If there is an easier way to just delete everything certificate/jar/java related and starting over with a fresh install I wouldn't mind doing that. </p>

<p>Many of the suggestions online state to simply force signing a jar file with key tools. I've tried opening key tools in the /bin directory of java with no success. I'm fairly new to the command prompt so I apologize if some terms go over my head. Thank you to everyone for any suggestions or help to this ugly problem.</p>

<p>Now, if I build my solution with errors, they will show up in the build output, but not all of them will appear in the error list.  It would appear only errors of open files will show up in the error list.  This is incredibly annoying.</p>

<p>I am not alone in this issue.  It has been reported many times on Microsoft's forums, but no one has a definitive solution.</p>

<p>I have tried a variety of solutions people suggested in those threads:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have ensured the filters are legitimate: Entire Solution, Errors enabled, Build + Intellisense.</li>
<li>I have tried deleting the .vs folder and restarting Visual Studio.</li>

<p>I have experienced this before in other versions of Visual Studio with Razor pages.  To my knowledge, that's to be expected in Razor though.</p>

<p>The only other factor that I severely doubt impacts anything is that it's a Visual Studio project generated by Unity editor.  From what I've read, ASP.NET, Razor, Xamarin, and other frameworks have each had their own version of issue reported.  Perhaps Unity is afflicted by it too, but I don't see how or why.  I doubt Unity's auto-generated Visual Studio projects are <em>that</em> different from your standard library projects.</p>

When would I use a Hybrid flow with response_type=code id_token token in OpenID Connect?,"<p>I have been reading about OpenId Connect and their flows that are <strong>implicit flow</strong>, <strong>authorization code flow</strong> and <strong>hybrid flow</strong>.</p>

<p>I know that for example, the implicit flow is kind of insecure and should be used just in public clients like SPA application.</p>

<p>Now I´m trying to understand the Hybrid Flow that can be used for non-public applications like .Net MVC applications where you have a backchannel communication and thus you can save a secret password.</p>

<p>Reading about the Hybrid flow I know that it has 3 different types of response_type that can be:</p>

<ol>
<li>code id_token</li>
<li>code token</li>
<li>code id_token token</li>
</ol>

<p>For me, the best response_type would be code id_token where I can get the code in the front channel and then send that code to the Identity Server Provider and get the access token through the backchannel.</p>

<p>I've been searching for information on a real-world application of <strong>response_type=code id_token token</strong>, or <strong>code token</strong>, but other than reading that in these flows the first token/s are issued by the authorization endpoint which is the front channel and the final tokens that are issued by exchanging the authorization code are issued at the token endpoint, which is the backchannel and thus inherently accepted as being more secure, I fail to understand what you would use this for. Any information would be gladly accepted.</p>

Configure multiple transformers/resolvers using metro,"<p>I'm trying to add multiple resolvers and transformers using metro for my react native project, how do I combine them in my metro.config.js file?</p>

<p>Background: I want to get both a sass transformer to work as well as a svg transformer.</p>

<p>I've tried the configurations separately and that seems to work, but I'm confused to how I combine them so they both work at the same time. I'm assuming they need to be in the same module.exports, because when they both are in the same file I get errors for my svg's</p>

<p>These are the configs I'm trying to combine:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = (async () =&gt; {
  const {
    resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts }
  } = await getDefaultConfig();
  return {
    transformer: {
      babelTransformerPath: require.resolve(""react-native-svg-transformer"")
    },
    resolver: {
      assetExts: assetExts.filter(ext =&gt; ext !== ""svg""),
      sourceExts: [...sourceExts, ""svg""]
    }
  };
})();

module.exports = (async () =&gt; {
  const {

    }
  };
})();

How to create some random or unique value in a CloudFormation template?,"<p>Is there a way to create some kind of random or unique value in a CloudFormation template?</p>

<p>Why I need this. In our templates we have a number of custom-named resources, for instance <code>AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration</code> with specified <code>LaunchConfigurationName</code> or <code>AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup</code> with specified <code>AutoScalingGroupName</code>.<br>
When updating stacks, we often get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CloudFormation cannot update a stack when a custom-named resource requires replacing. Rename some-stack-launch-configuration and update the stack again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don't want to rename resources just because we need to update them.<br>
We also don't want to drop custom names in our resources. We won't mind however having some random suffix in our custom names.</p>

<p>With a ""random generator"" the solution might look something like:</p>

<pre><code>  MyAutoScalingGroup:
    Type: 'AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup'
    Properties:
      AutoScalingGroupName: !Sub 'my-auto-scaling-group-${AWS::Random}'

"SwiftUI: How to display modal sheet on top of DetailView, not MasterView in regular mode","<p>I have a Master->Detail app. The DetailView displays a modal sheet. This works fine on a iPhone XR in portait. But in landscape, the modal sheet does not appear on top of the DetailView, but on top of the MasterView instead.</p>

<p>How to prevent that?</p>

<p>I'm using NavigationView inside the modal sheet. If I remove it, the problem seems to go away. Except that I no longer have a title and close button, which I need.</p>

<p>Here's the definition of the master view:</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                    Text (""Master 1"")
                }
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                    Text (""Master 2"")
                }
            }
            .navigationBarTitle(Text(""Master""))
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pressing a row will display the modal sheet:</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>struct DetailView: View {
    @State var isPresented = false

    var body: some View {
        List {
            Button(""Detail 1"") {
                self.isPresented = true
            }
            Button(""Detail 2"") {
                self.isPresented = true
            }
        }
        .navigationBarTitle(Text(""Detail""))
        .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented, content: {
            SheetView()
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The modal sheet relies on NavigationView to have a title and close button. But as a result the modal will be displayed on top of the master view in regular (landscape).</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>struct SheetView: View {
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode: Binding&lt;PresentationMode&gt;

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView { // Mandatory for Title and Button
            Form {
                Text(""Modal 1"")
                Text(""Modal 2"")
            }
            .navigationBarTitle(Text(""Some Modal""))
            .navigationBarItems(
                trailing: Button(action: {
                    self.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
                }) {
                    Text(""Close"")

How do I write flavor specifc code in react-native?,"<p>About a week ago I starded developing a white-label app, where the only thing that will differ from app to app are some color values, source of images and API endpoints, but the app itself does the exact same thing.</p>

<p>So the last couple of days I tryied to learn how to build multiple apps from the same project... (lets mainly focus on Android here) thru my journey I found a few guides and I managed to make it work by following <a href=""https://medium.com/@ywongcode/building-multiple-versions-of-a-react-native-app-4361252ddde5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this guide</a> and setting product flavors in my build.gradle.</p>

<pre><code>    productFlavors {
    firstapp {
        applicationIdSuffix '.firstapp'
        resValue ""string"", ""build_config_package"", ""com.myapp""
    }
    secondapp {
        applicationIdSuffix '.secondapp'
        resValue ""string"", ""build_config_package"", ""com.myapp""
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now I can run<code>react-native run-android --variant=firstappDebug</code> to emulate the app while developing, and latter on release <code>gradlew assembleFirstappRelease</code> and be able to generate multiple (in this case 2) different builds.</p>

<p>But, as im quite a begginer, I couldnt find the proper way to write flavor specific code to be rendered whenever I build for that specific flavor.</p>

<p>In addition, I followed <a href=""https://hackernoon.com/setting-up-android-like-product-flavors-in-react-native-39b6c011061b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this other guide</a> that more or less shows how to do that, but again, I lack knowledge to proper execute some steps so I failed there. I couldnt figure out in what file should I right the code at <strong>STEP 2</strong> and neither what is <code>BuildConfig.FLAVOR</code>, <code>NSBundle.mainBundle()</code>, and at <strong>STEP 3</strong> <code>UtilityManager.getTarget()</code>, <code>RNBuildConfig.FLAVOR</code></p>

<p>In conclusion.. Im still studying hard to grow and Ill look more deeply in environment varibles... but I felt the need to ask the community for help.</p>

Cannot resume AudioContext in Safari,"<p>I'm running into an issue where calling <code>resume</code> on an <code>AudioContext</code> never resolves when attempting to play audio in Safari. I'm creating an <code>AudioContext</code> on page load, thus it starts in a suspended state.</p>

<p><a href=""https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=884337"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to this chromium issue</a>, calling <code>resume</code> will not resolve if blocked by the browser's autoplay policy. I have a click event bound to a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> that will resume the context if it's suspended. This works in both Firefox and Chrome, and will work in Safari <strong>if</strong> I change the autoplay settings for the site.</p>

<p>Below is how I would normally resume the context:</p>

<pre><code>await context.resume();
</code></pre>

<p>For Safari, I've tried calling resume without waiting for the promise to resolve, and instead register a callback for <code>onstatechange</code>, which is then wrapped in a <code>Promise</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (window.webkitAudioContext) {
    await new Promise((accept, reject) =&gt; {
        this.context.onstatechange = async () =&gt; {
            if ((await this.context.state) === ""playing"") {
                accept();

                reject();
            }
         };

        this.context.resume();
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, nothing has changed: the <code>Promise</code> never resolves, which means that the context state isn't changing.</p>

<p>I'm setting up a Postman Collection with only one Post request to be called. On the Postman script, I parameterized only 4 fields for testing purposes.

"In TypeScript, what do &quot;extends keyof&quot; and &quot;in keyof&quot; mean?","<p>In TypeScript, some types are defined using <code>extends keyof</code> or <code>in keyof</code>. I have tried to understand what they mean, but so far I didn't succeed.</p>
<p>What I got is that <code>keyof</code> alone returns a union type which has all the names as possible values that are existent as property names on the type that you specify after <code>keyof</code>.</p>
<pre><code>type T = keyof string;

<p><code>T</code> therefor is equivalent to <code>startsWith | endsWith | trim | substring | ...</code>.</p>

<li><code>extends keyof</code> is any type that derives from <code>T</code>, i.e. it has all these possible values, but maybe more.</li>
<li><code>in keyof</code> is any type that takes values from <code>T</code>, but not necessarily all of them (it's possible, but maybe less).</li>

SwiftUI: How to pop to Root view,"<p>Finally now with Beta 5 we can programmatically pop to a parent View. However, there are several places in my App where a View has a ""Save"" button that concludes a several step process and returns to the beginning.  In UIKit, I use popToRootViewController(), but I have been unable to figure out a way to do the same in SwiftUI. </p>

<p>Below is a simple example of the pattern I'm trying to achieve.  Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>import SwiftUI

struct DetailViewB: View {
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode: Binding&lt;PresentationMode&gt;
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(""This is Detail View B."")

            Button(action: { self.presentationMode.value.dismiss() } )
            { Text(""Pop to Detail View A."") }

            Button(action: { /* How to do equivalent to popToRootViewController() here?? */ } )
            { Text(""Pop two levels to Master View."") }

        }
    }
}

struct DetailViewA: View {
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode: Binding&lt;PresentationMode&gt;
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(""This is Detail View A."")

            NavigationLink(destination: DetailViewB() )
            { Text(""Push to Detail View B."") }

            Button(action: { self.presentationMode.value.dismiss() } )
            { Text(""Pop one level to Master."") }
        }
    }

Sequelize returns null for Postgres &#39;timestamp with time zone&#39; columns,"<p>I'm new to Sequelize and am having trouble getting <code>timestamp</code> data from a Postgres database. Everything I have tried so far returns <code>null</code> for all <code>timestamp</code> fields.</p>

<p>Below are the Postgres definitions for the columns in question:</p>

<pre><code>created_date timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp,
updated_date timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp,
</code></pre>

<p>These are all the different ways I've attempted to define the relevant portion of the model in Node.js (tried the same things for updated_date):</p>

<pre><code>created_date: {
  type: Sequelize.DATE
  defaultValue: Sequelize.NOW,
  allowNull: false
},
created_date: {
  type: 'TIMESTAMP',
  defaultValue: sequelize.literal('CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'),
  allowNull: false
},
created_date: {
  type: 'timestamp with time zone',
  defaultValue: sequelize.literal('current_timestamp'),
  allowNull: false
},
created_date: {
  type: Sequelize.STRING,
},
</code></pre>

<p>For all combinations the Sequelize <code>timestamp</code> attribute has been set to <code>false</code> (because we are handling them manually). I've tried to change this value to <code>true</code> as well with no success.</p>

<p>Lastly, the query is structured like so (notice the two different ways I've attempted to access the columns below):</p>

<pre><code>data = await &lt;MyModel&gt;.findAll({
  order: [['created_date', 'DESC']],
  attributes: [
    'id',
    ['created_date', 'createdDate'],
    [models.sequelize.col('&lt;my_table&gt;.updated_date'), 'updatedDate'],
    ...
  ],
  ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>All attempts have returned <code>null</code> for both <code>timestamp</code> values from the database. I have verified that the <code>timestamp</code> values in the database do exist and are not <code>null</code>. And, all other database values are being returned as expected.</p>

<p>Using Sequelize <code>v5.9.4</code></p>

<p>Any help tracking down the root cause of this issue will be greatly appreciated. I've spent way too many hours trying to figure this one out. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Edit - More information that may be relevant:</p>

<p>The following is the metadata that is returned from running a raw query through Sequelize:</p>

&quot;React has detected a change in the order of Hooks&quot; but Hooks seem to be invoked in order,"<p>I am trying to use <code>Context</code> and <code>Reducers</code> via React's hooks, and running into problems with the order of the hooks not being constant.

Otherwise, I'm invoking the hooks at the very beginning of the FunctionComponents. </p>

<p>I've retried after deleting the cache with ""php bin/console c:c"" and even deleted the whole folder, but still its not working.</p>

<p>Thanks to @emix, we've narrowed the problem. After clearing the logs and retry i can see the following:</p>

<pre><code>[2019-08-26 11:23:35] doctrine.DEBUG: SELECT * FROM sys.user_tables [] []
</code></pre>

<p>So now i know that doctrine is trying to locate the currently owned tables from the user. But the data.ACCOUNT table lies in another schema and the table was granted ""select"". This table is not owned by this user. </p>

<p>So how can i tell doctrine to look into another schema for the granted tables?</p>

Terraform taint with multiple resources,"<p>I have a need to taint a bunch of resources in my pipeline to force recreation of these. As I keep my state in remote backend, every <code>terraform taint</code> needs to:</p>
<ul>

<li>taint the resource</li>
<li>upload the state</li>
<li>release lock</li>
</ul>
<p>and repeat that 30 times or so. Can't be done in parallel, so it takes much more time than I'd be happy with. <code>terraform taint</code> does not like multiple resources on the taint command. Is anyone aware of a method to speed this up?</p>

How can I wrap a variadic template member function of a variadic template class in SWIG?,"<p>I have a header file containing the definition of a variadic template, which also contains a few variadic templated member functions. Code snippets below have been significantly simplified and cut down for brevity:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#pragma once

template&lt;typename T, typename ... CtorArgs&gt;
class Foo {
public:
  Foo(CtorArgs... args) : _m(args...) {}

  template&lt;typename ... Args&gt;
  void DoSomething(Args... args) { _m.DoSomething(args...); }
private:
  T _m;
};

</code></pre>

<p>I then have another header defining a class to be used in a template specialization:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#pragma once

#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Bar {
public:
  Bar(std::string const &amp; a,
      std::string const &amp; b) :
        m_strA(a),
        m_strB(b) {}

  void DoSomething(int const one, int const two) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Str A: "" &lt;&lt; m_strA &lt;&lt; "", Str B: ""&lt;&lt;  m_strB &lt;&lt; "", ints: "" &lt;&lt; one &lt;&lt; "", "" &lt;&lt; two &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }

private:
  std::string m_strA;
  std::string m_strB;
};

</code></pre>

<p>I would like to wrap the <strong>Foo</strong> specialization using SWIG, as well as its templated member function, so I can use them from a Lua script.</p>

<p>The problem I am encountering is that SWIG is not generating a wrapper for the DoSomething templated function as I expect.</p>

<p>After reading some of the SWIG documentation, I am aware that it is unable to use the <strong>%template</strong> directive with more than 1 substitution for the parameter pack arguments, so I have used <strong>%rename</strong> instead:</p>

<pre><code>%module FooSwig
%include &lt;std_string.i&gt;

%{
#include ""foo.hpp""
#include ""bar.hpp""
%}

%include ""foo.hpp""
%include ""bar.hpp""

%rename(lua_foo) Foo&lt;Bar, std::string const &amp;, std::string const &amp;&gt;;
class Foo&lt;Bar, std::string const &amp;, std::string const &amp;&gt; {
public:
  Foo(std::string const &amp;, std::string const &amp;);

  template&lt;typename ... Args&gt;
  void DoSomething(Args... args);
private:
  Bar _m;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <strong>%template</strong> directive doesn't work (as expected), as there are more than 1 parameters to substitute - I get the following from swig:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: Template 'DoSomething' undefined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I imagine I need to get around this using <strong>%rename</strong> again, but I can't figure out how. I've tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>%extend Foo&lt;Bar, std::string const &amp;, std::string const &amp;&gt;
{
  %rename(Do_Something) DoSomething&lt;int const, int const&gt;;
  void DoSomething(int const, int const);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that does generate something, but the wrapper contains a symbol for a function that is undefined:</p>

<pre><code>Foo_Sl_Bar_Sc_std_string_SS_const_SA__Sc_std_string_SS_const_SA__Sg__DoSomething(arg1,arg2,arg3);
</code></pre>

<p>instead of the expected call to a member function template, something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>(arg1)-&gt;SWIGTEMPLATEDISAMBIGUATOR DoSomething&lt;int const, int const&gt;(arg2, arg3);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm running out of things to try, and maybe one of you can help?</p>

<p>Some info about my environment:

Django sessions: How to include session ID in every log record?,"<p>I would like to include session ID (at least portion of it) in every log entry in Django. This would help me group together logs for each user session in case several users are interacting with my Django API at the same time.</p>

<p>I know I can retrieve session ID from Request object (when it exists) but I would have to do so for every logger.info() across the whole framework. Instead it would be much better to have Request somehow available in settings.py so that I can prepend the ID to my formatter's format string inside LOGGING config.</p>

<p>This would ensure that the session ID is included in every log entry and I would not need to think about it in every view or serializer, etc.</p>

<p>But I haven't found a way how to make Request or Session available in settings.py.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To explain further. I have the following signal in place to catch user login and log this event when it happens. I want to add session ID to this message. But I want Django to do it for any message in the system by default - I don't want to fetch the session ID inside the log_user_login function and any other function in my code.</p>

<p>So in the following code I want to fire up logger event, but with no session ID specified.</p>

<pre><code>import logging
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.signals import user_logged_in

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@receiver(user_logged_in)
def log_user_login(sender, user, request, **kwargs):
    logger.info(f""User {user.username} logged in."")
</code></pre>

<p>I want Django to add session ID then automatically via the configuration in settings.py, for illustration with following code:</p>

<pre><code>def add_session_id(record):
    record.attrs = record.__dict__.keys()
    return True


LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'filters': {
        'add_session_id': {
            '()': 'django.utils.log.CallbackFilter',
            'callback': add_session_id,
        }
    },
    'formatters': {
        'file': {
            'format': '%(attrs)s',
        },
    },
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would log the following message:</p>

<pre><code>dict_keys(['name', 'msg', 'args', 'levelname', 'levelno', 'pathname', 'filename', 'module', 'exc_info', 'exc_text', 'stack_info', 'lineno', 'funcName', 'created', 'msecs', 'relativeCreated', 'thread', 'threadName', 'processName', 'process', 'attrs', 'message', 'asctime'])
</code></pre>

<p>So to me it looks like mentioned record contains neither Request nor Session.</p>

Style @Html.DisplayFor text with color in Razor view,"<p>I'm trying to change the color of the output of a <code>@Html.DisplayFor</code> call. It's simple text. I've created css classes and tried to style it directly in the Razor view, but nothing is working. There is no issue with the model (it renders the correct text). There are many similar questions (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6887072/how-can-i-apply-styling-to-asp-net-mvc-html-textboxfor"">one</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42633659/asp-net-mvc-adding-css-to-your-view-inside-of-the-view-not-an-external-css-f"">two</a>, <a href=""https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/forums/how-to-apply-style-in-mvc-label"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">three</a>), but none of those solutions have worked for me. The initial attempt was within an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag, but I've tried outside it as well. Here's my attempts in the view (I've tried a few things...):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { @class = ""h3.link-colour;"" })&lt;/h3&gt;
@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { @class = ""h3.link-colour"" })
@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { @class = ""link-colour""})
@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { @class = ""link-colour"" })
@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { @style = ""color:#00BFFF"" })
@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Title, new { @style = ""color:#00BFFF !important;"" })

<p>Relevant part of site.css here:</p>

<pre><code>/* colour links */

}

.link-colour {
    color: #00BFFF !important;
}

<p>The css works for other aspects of the view. In the Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file, there is <code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""~/css/site.css"" /&gt;</code>. I've been able to apply the technique of <code>new { @class = ""link-colour"" }</code> within a call to <code>@Html.ActionLink</code> in another view in this project, so I'm not sure what's going on. I've cleared the browser cache, too. Thanks for any ideas.</p>

1. The plugin name is spelled incorrectly in an ESLint configuration file (e.g. .eslintrc).
2. If ESLint is installed globally, then make sure 'eslint-plugin-react' is installed globally as well.
3. If ESLint is installed locally, then 'eslint-plugin-react' isn't installed correctly.

<p>As you can see they are basically the same but the parameter type.
Since I am just printing them which means use the &quot;.toString()&quot; method I think there should be a way to use the same method for both.</p>
<p>I tried</p>
<pre><code>public static void printRoutes(List&lt;Optional&lt;T super Object&gt;&gt; lengths)

Is there a way to do it? or you can't use generics in this case.</p>

Please check that your Ethereum client:
- is running
- is accepting RPC connections (i.e., ""--rpc"" option is used in geth)

How do I update browserslist?,"<p>Does browserslist update automatically or do I have to manually update it? Is there a command to force it to update?</p>

<p>E.g. the targets for the ""last 1 version"" directive would change whenever a new browser version is launched. How does my local copy of browserslist know when a new version is launched? At what point does it sync with browserslist's server? Does it update periodically, every time it's used, or only when you update the package?</p>

<p>The existing answers only give vague answers such as ""it will always fetch the latest version"" or ""it will find target browsers automatically"". However, it doesn't answer <strong>when</strong> it updates. Obviously my local version of browserslist wouldn't update as soon as a new browser version is released, there will be a delay.</p>

Using Recyclerview with DiffUtil.ItemCallback doesn&#39;t scroll to top?,"<p>I do search of items and every time I fetch from server
When I search ""o"" it works and then ""ot"" it works again and as a result of ""o"" search I have let's say 20 items and in case ""ot"" I have 10 items 
which are part of that 20 items and I do remove t in EditText it shows 20 items only the recyclerview scroll indicator is in the middle 
Here is my Code for diffUtil</p>

Opening file from Files app when file not downloaded (using Open In Place),"<p>I want my users to be able to tap on a file in the Files app and have it sent to my app. Previously I've had the app setup to successfully be able to open files from Mail when files are shared that way using ""Open in "".  The filetype I'm using is custom to my app. The document type, Exported UTIs, and Imported UTIs were created in order to enable ""Open in "" and hasn't been changed.</p>

<p>I'm getting an error if the file hasn't been downloaded inside the Files app already (the small cloud with a down arrow is next to the filename). Even if you long tap on it and select ""Share"" and the use ""Open in "", I get the same error.  </p>

<p>If the file was added to Files from that device, it's already downloaded and tapping on it in Files works just fine. How can I force Files to download the file before sending it over to my app? I've searched online and the only reference I can find is here: <a href=""https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/47890"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/47890</a> which the very last post talks about the same problem, but I can't find a solution anywhere.</p>

<p>In my info.plist file, I have my app setup to ""Support opening documents in place"" set to YES.  I also have set ""Application supports iTunes file sharing"" set to YES.</p>

<p>I'm checking the value of options[.openInPlace] from the <code>application(_:open:options:)</code> method to detect that the file is coming from the Files app. I had to add the call to <code>url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()</code> before it would work at all when the file was already downloaded on the device.</p>

<p>Here's a stripped down version of the code that's doing the processing:</p>

<pre><code>func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -&gt; Bool {
let isOpenInPlace = options[.openInPlace] as? Bool
var securityScopedResource = false

if isOpenInPlace {
    securityScopedResource = url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()
}

do {
    let data = try Data(contentsOf: url)
    // Use the data to create something inside my app

    if securityScopedResource {
        url.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()

<p>I've already tried playing with <code>.MultiSelect</code>, it did not help. It is actually set to <code>fmMultiSelectSingle</code> but the ideal would be <code>fmMultiSelectMulti</code>. 
Am I misunderstanding something?</p>

I have tried SeparatorVisibility=""None"" property also, but no luck.</p>

<p>I have tried <a href=""https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/3599"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> solution provided by GitHub, but it is not working.</p>

<p>Here is the code :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;GridLayout row=""1"" class=""shop-list-container""&gt;
    &lt;ListView [items]=""rewardsPageData?.shops"" class=""list-group""  height=""{{rewardsPageData?.shops?.length * 75}}"" separatorColor=""transparent""&gt;
        &lt;ng-template let-shop=""item""&gt;
            &lt;GridLayout class=""shop-item list-group-item"" columns=""2*, 6*, 2*"" rows=""*, auto"" (tap)=""goToShopDetails(shop.id)""&gt;

Javascript Calculate Season,"<p>I looked around Stack and found a few other examples of calculating the season from a Date but I was not sure about performance if it was passed thousands of Date objects.  The other Stack OP, someone advised that converting the Date to time and then comparing the integers was the most perfoamant so I wrote the following function to calculate the season of the date passed.</p>

<pre><code>function season(d) {
  day = new Date(d);
  days = day.getTime();

  const SPRING_START = new Date(day.getFullYear(), 2, (day.getFullYear() % 4 === 1) ? 19 : 20).getTime();
  const SUMMER_START = new Date(day.getFullYear(), 5, (day.getFullYear() % 4 === 1) ? 20 : 21).getTime();
  const AUTUMN_START = new Date(day.getFullYear(), 8, (day.getFullYear() % 4 === 1) ? 22 : 23).getTime();
  const AUTUMN_END = new Date(day.getFullYear(), 11, (day.getFullYear() % 4 === 1) ? 20 : 21).getTime();

  const s = [SPRING_START, SUMMER_START, AUTUMN_START, AUTUMN_END];
  const S_NAME = [""Spring"", ""Summer"", ""Autumn"", ""Winter""];

  for( i = 0; i &lt; s.length - 1; i++ ) {

How to I solve this sass interpolation issue,"<p>WARNING: You probably don't mean to use the color value white in interpolation here.
It may end up represented as white, which will likely produce invalid CSS.
Always quote color names when using them as strings or map keys (for example, ""white"").
If you really want to use the color value here, use '"""" + $colorName'.</p>

In other words, is it possible that after step 3 is performed and the condition is satisfied and before step 4 is performed (which prevents adding new such tuples) another thread inserts one such tuple into the database and result in a set flag while one such tuple is in the database?</p>

Why need useRef to contain mutable variable but not define variable outside the component function?,"<p>I have read <a href=""https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/#swimming-against-the-tide"" rel=""noreferrer"">A Complete Guide to useEffect - Swimming Against the Tide</a> at Overreacted. </p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      // Read the mutable latest value
      console.log(`You clicked ${latestCount.current} times`);
    }, 3000);
  });
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can do the same thing by creating a variable outside the component function, such as:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

// defined a variable outside function component
let countCache = 0;

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  countCache = count;       // set default value

      // We can get the latest count here
      console.log(`You clicked ${countCache} times (countCache)`);
    }, 3000);

Need to downgrade chromedriver for Protractor to match earlier Chrome version,"<p>I am currently trying to get some existing Protractor tests running properly for an app that I will be doing QA work for. However, it looks like I will need to use an earlier version of chromedriver to sync up with the version of Chrome I am using (71.x) but I am not sure how to get Protractor to use a different version as it always downloads v76. Why do I need to do this? Context below.</p>

<p>After pulling the code from the repository, I did an ""npm install"" in the ""/e2e"" directory according to the instructions left by the previous dev, as well as updating things through webdriver-manager using ""webdriver-manager update."" When running Selenium, I got the ""Invalid or corrupt jar file"" error that is apparently an issue with the 4.0.0-alpha-1 and alpha-2 versions, so I downgraded Selenium to the standalone version 3.141.59.</p>

<p>This worked until I realized that when running the tests, the app didn't recognize the browser as being Chrome and failed the tests (it requires Chrome to run) even though it was definitely running Chrome. So, I had to downgrade my local machine's version of Chrome down to match the chromedriver version that my update pulled - I believe it was running chromedriver v75 and I was running v76 on my local machine.</p>

<p>I was told by a QA colleague that I should be running Chrome v71.x since that is what we are using for our release pipeline. So, I uninstalled Chrome and got Chrome v71.x, making sure that auto-updating was disabled. This means I need to get the version of chromedriver that matches this, which appears to be v2.46 from the digging I did online. </p>

<p>Now, to my core issue. Every time I try to update things through webdriver-manager it always downloads the latest version of chromedriver (v76) and I don't know how to get Protractor to use an earlier version. I have downloaded chromedriver 2.46 manually - I am guessing I need to point it to this version somehow, but messing with the config json files has not yielded any luck for me and I haven't found a good answer online.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated as I am still new to how all this works.</p>

<p>Update: I went into the pod where the ingress controller is running and checked its config file and found that ingress resources are not applied to the controller. I tried relaunching the container with no luck. I also tried reapplying the ingress resource but the config file in the pod is not changing. Everything that goes to controller is throwing 404 as in location tag in the config file. Any help is appreciated on why the resource is not getting applied to the controller</p>

Angular S3 Static Website - 403 Forbidden Routing Error,"<p>I know there are other questions on stack overflow similar to this, but I haven't yet been able to resolve my issue.  I have an Angular 7 app that I am hosting in S3 using the static website hosting.  I haven't yet purchased a domain or set up CloudFront, as I am still in development of the site.</p>

<p>My issue is that routing is working properly when navigation is triggered by a click event in the nav bar (the code uses router-link), but if I hit refresh on any page other than the root (""/"") I get a 403 Forbidden error from S3:</p>

<p>As I stated, the angular routing seems to be working properly, as I am using router-link in the code to handle navigation, here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a routerLink=""/services""&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my app-routing.module.ts code:</p>

<pre><code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent }, 
  { path: 'about-us', component: AboutUsComponent }, 
  { path: 'new-patients', component: NewPatientsComponent }, 
  { path: 'services', component: ServicesProvidedComponent },

  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking, based on other solutions I've read, that I need to somehow re-direct to the index page so that the Angular router will kick in, but I'm not sure what configuration I need to add.  I thought adding the default route ('**') would take care of that, but clearly I was wrong.</p>

<p>When I do my deployments to S3 I always select the option to make all the files publicly accessible, so I do not think that is the issue here.</p>

Error 1002 in applescript that uses &quot;key code&quot; when called from macOS app,"<p>I'm trying to run an AppleScript from my macOS app (Mojave, Xcode 10.3). However, when the AppleScript is run from the app, I get this error: </p>

<p><code>/Users/my_username/Desktop/test_apple_script.scpt: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed to send keystrokes. (1002)</code></p>

<p>Based on other posts, I have made sure that my app can control my computer (System Preferences > Security &amp; Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility), and it also has control over System Events (System Preferences > Security &amp; Privacy > Privacy > Automation). </p>

<p>Here is my AppleScript:</p>

<pre><code>tell application ""System Events""
    key code 48 using {command down}
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>The script works when run in Script Editor (I only had to give Script Editor the access in System Preferences > Security &amp; Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility). </p>

<p>This is the code I am using to run the Apple Script from my app (via <code>osascript</code>):</p>

<pre><code>let proc = Process()
proc.launchPath = ""/usr/bin/env""
proc.arguments = [""/usr/bin/osascript"",""/Users/my_username/Desktop/test_apple_script.scpt""]
proc.launch()
</code></pre>

<p>This code works perfectly when I run a simple AppleScript that just displays a notification:</p>

<pre><code>tell application ""System Events""
    display dialog ""Test""
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>How can I make it so that my AppleScript runs from my macOS app just as it does when I run it in Script Editor?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For some more context, the command tab case here is just an example. I am trying to find a generalizable approach to simulating keyboard shortcuts by clicking buttons in my app (e.g., the user clicks on the ""cut"" button and the app acts as if the user has just pressed command + x). There may be a better approach to this than using an AppleScript, but I know that it is possible to do what I want using AppleScripts. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In case it wasn't clear from my original question, the simple AppleScript that displays a notification was already working from within my app. The problem arises when I try to run an AppleScript that simulates user input from the keyboard. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This code here worked for me temporarily, but it no longer works. I did not change the code at all. I simply ran my app again. </p>

<pre><code>let PlayPauseScript = ""tell application \""Spotify\""\n playpause\n end tell""\""test\""\n end tell""
if let scriptObject = NSAppleScript(source: PlayPauseScript) {
    scriptObject.executeAndReturnError(nil)
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> 
Here is where the problem currently stands. Based on suggestions, I added this to my <code>info.plist</code>, and now the Spotify AppleScript consistently works (when called via NSAppleScript): </p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;NSAppleEventsUsageDescription&lt;/key&gt; 
&lt;string&gt;...this is why I need permission...&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It seems my problem (now) is just with AppleScripts that use System Events. Despite making sure that both my app and <code>osascript</code> are allowed to control my computer (via security &amp; privacy > privacy > accessibility), I now get the same error (1002) when using <code>NEAppleScript</code> and <code>osascript</code>. My app is also allowed to control System Events (security &amp; privacy > privacy > automation). The <code>osascript</code> error prints to the console in Xcode, and I uncovered the error code for <code>NEAppleScript</code> by using this code (in the @IBAction of the button):</p>

<pre><code>let script =
""""""
try
    tell application ""System Events""
        keystroke ""c"" using {command down}
    end tell
on error errMsg number errorNumber
    display dialog ""An unknown error occurred:  "" &amp; errorNumber as text
end try
""""""

if let scriptObject = NSAppleScript(source: script) {
    scriptObject.executeAndReturnError(nil)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code caused this to appear in the dialog box:
<code>An unknown error occurred: 1002</code></p>

<p>When my app is run, it does prompt me to give it control over System Events, which I always do. My app is not sandboxed. I believe that both <code>NSAppleScript</code> and <code>oascript</code> <em>did</em> work for me once, but stopped working when I ran the app again (despite my not having made any changes to my code, I'm almost positive).</p>

<p>I don't know if this is informative, but the only other clue I have as to what might be going on is that I keep having to check and uncheck Script Editor's permission in <code>security &amp; privacy &gt; privacy &gt; accessibility</code> to get it to run these AppleScripts because it tells me that Script Editor is not allowed to send keystrokes.</p>

How to pull image so it can be analyzed for getcolors class,"<p>I am writing a program to analyze images (paintings, drawings, etc).  The <code>dominant_color</code> function should return a list of tuples <code>[(count, (r#, b#, g#)), ...]</code> sorted by <code>count</code> in descending order.</p>

<p>Following is the script, but I'm not certain how to correctly give <code>filename</code> a valid value.</p>

<p>I have tried <code>filename = 'path to file'</code>, but get a <code>syntax error</code>, unless the code is run in PyCharm.</p>

<pre><code>def dominant_color(filename):

    image = Image.open(filename)
    image = image.resize((width, height), resample = 0)
    #Convert image to RGB
    im_rgb = im.convert('RGB')
    #Get colors from image object
    pixels = image.getcolors(width * height)
    #Sort them by count number(first element of tuple)
    sorted_pixels = sorted(pixels, key=lambda t: t[0])
    return sorted_pixels

How do I do this? I would super appreciate any code examples that would be huge. I know others have this problem as well. </p>

<p>Here is my Server side code </p>

<pre><code>const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const http = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http);

  app.use(express.static('public'));

   var PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000

   app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('index.ejs');

   });




io.sockets.on('connection', function(socket) {
    socket.on('username', function(username) {
        socket.username = username;
        io.emit('is_online', '🔵 &lt;i&gt;' + socket.username + ' join the chat..&lt;/i&gt;');
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', function(username) {
        io.emit('is_online', '🔴 &lt;i&gt;' + socket.username + ' left the 
chat..&lt;/i&gt;');
    })

    socket.on('chat_message', function(message) {
        io.emit('chat_message', '&lt;strong&gt;' + socket.username + '&lt;/strong&gt;: ' + message);
    });

});

const server = http.listen(PORT, function() {
    console.log('listening on *:3000');
});

Error: ER_NO_DB_ERROR: No database selected (Node.js + MySql) when always using database qualified object references,"<p>What I'm trying to achieve is the ability to access tables within two databases by using database qualified table names (without specifically setting the default database with an SQL <code>USE</code> statement). My JavaScript application running on Node.js v10.15.3 is connecting to MySql with the NPM mysql 2.17.1 library as follows:</p>

<pre><code>const mysql = require('mysql');

...

let configuration = {
    host: ""localhost"",
    port: 3306,
    user: ""user"",
    password: ""password""
};

let connection = mysql.createConnection(configuration);
</code></pre>

<p>The connection is made but when I query using database qualified table names</p>

<pre><code>let select = 'SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM application.table;';

connection.query(select);
</code></pre>

<p>I get:</p>

<pre><code>(node:20332) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: ER_NO_DB_ERROR: No database selected
</code></pre>

<p>My guess is that this error was the mysql NPM library detecting that I hadn't specified a database to use, so I tried adding the following before the SELECT statement:</p>

<pre><code>connection.query(`USE application;`);
</code></pre>

<p>...and now I get:</p>

<pre><code>(node:10412) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE: Table 'application.application.table' doesn't exist
</code></pre>

<p>So, the Node <code>mysql</code> library appears to be prepending the database name everywhere I reference any database object...</p>

<p>I'm actually storing the database qualified table names as JavaScript strings of the form <code>'application.table'</code> or <code>'metadata.table'</code> and would prefer to keep these in this format for simplicity of management (e.g. if the design required a table were to move from one database to the other we only need to change the string that references the table in one place).</p>

<p>Is there a Node mysql library configuration option to assure it that all database object references will be database qualified?</p>

Where to store the refresh token on the Client?,"<p>My SPA application uses the following architecture (<a href=""https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a>):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPJjA.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPJjA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This assumes that my client application knows about the refresh token, because I need it to request a new access token if no user credentials (e.g. email/password) are present.</p>

<p>My question: <strong>Where do I store the refresh token in my client-side application?</strong> There are lots of questions/answers about this topic on SO, but regarding the refresh token the answer are not clear.</p>

<p>Access token and refresh token shouldn't be stored in the local/session storage, because they are not a place for any sensitive data. Hence I would store the <strong>access token</strong> in a <code>httpOnly</code> cookie (even though there is CSRF) and I need it for most of my requests to the Resource Server anyway.</p>

<p><strong>But what about the refresh token?</strong> I cannot store it in a cookie, because (1) it would be send with every request to my Resource Server as well which makes it vulnerable to CSRF too and (2) it would send expose both access/refresh token with an identical attack vector.</p>

<p>There are three solutions I could think of:</p>

<hr>

<p>1) Storing the refresh token in an in-memory JavaScript variable, which has two drawbacks: </p>

<ul>
<li>a) It's vulnerable to XSS (but may be not as obvious as local/session storage</li>
<li>b) It looses the ""session"" if a user closes the browser tab</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially the latter drawback makes will turn out as a bad UX.</p>

<hr>

<p>2) Storing the access token in session storage and sending it via a <code>Bearer access_token</code> authorization header to my resource server. Then I can use <code>httpOnly</code> cookies for the refresh token. This has one drawback that I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) The refresh token is exposed to CSRF with every request made to the Resource Server. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>3) Keep both tokens in <code>httpOnly</code> cookies which has the mentioned drawback that both tokens are exposed to the same attack vector.</p>

<hr>

<p>Maybe there is another way or more than my mentioned drawbacks (please let me know), but in the end everything boils down to <strong>where do I keep my refresh token on the client-side</strong>? Is it <code>httpOnly</code> cookie or an in-memory JS variable? If it is the former, where do I put my access token then? </p>

<p>Would be super happy to get any clues about how to do this the best way from people who are familiar with the topic.</p>

Flutter `showModalBottomSheet` Ticker was not disposed during tests,"<p>When writing a Flutter widget test I'm running into an error where the Ticker that was created during showModalBottomSheet() is not being disposed of.</p>

<p>I think I understand if I'm implementing my own Flutter animation I should make an AnimationController, and I would call <code>AnimationController.dispose()</code> during the widget <code>dispose</code> method.</p>

<p>However, since (I believe) the AnimationController is abstracted away to provide some convenience I'm not sure where or how to make sure the widget is disposed of after the tests are done. </p>

<p>Note: the code works and when I'm testing on the simulator/emulator the modal bottom sheet is great. I just want to be able to test it in a <code>testWidgets</code> test.</p>

<p>I've looked at the showModalBottomSheet documentation <a href=""https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showModalBottomSheet.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showModalBottomSheet.html</a> but that has only shown how to use the function. I'm not finding any way to control when I can dispose of the animation. </p>

<pre><code>The following assertion was thrown while finalizing the widget tree:
OverlayState#bfe06(tickers: tracking 1 ticker, entries: [OverlayEntry#c26ee(opaque: false;
maintainState: false), OverlayEntry#7cd4f(opaque: false; maintainState: true),
OverlayEntry#d496e(opaque: false; maintainState: false), OverlayEntry#e9ad3(opaque: false;
maintainState: true)]) was disposed with an active Ticker.
OverlayState created a Ticker via its TickerProviderStateMixin, but at the time dispose() was called
on the mixin, that Ticker was still active. All Tickers must be disposed before calling
super.dispose(). Tickers used by AnimationControllers should be disposed by calling dispose() on the
AnimationController itself. Otherwise, the ticker will leak.
The offending ticker was: _WidgetTicker(created by OverlayState#bfe06(tickers: tracking 0 tickers,
entries: [OverlayEntry#c26ee(opaque: false; maintainState: false), OverlayEntry#7cd4f(opaque: false;
maintainState: true)]))

<p><strong>If Life Was Easy:</strong></p>
<pre><code>master_df = master_df['Month'].to_datetime()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Back Story:</strong></p>
<p>I built a new dataFrame that originally summed the monthly totals and made a 'Month' column by converting a timestamp to period. Now I want to convert that time period back to a timestamp so that I can create plots using matplotlib.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hnJU4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hnJU4.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I have tried following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading the docs for <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Period.to_timestamp.html#pandas.Period.to_timestamp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Period.to_timestamp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Converting to a string and then back to datetime. Still keeps the period issue and won't convert.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Following a couple similar questions in Stackoverflow but could not seem to get it to work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A simple goal would be to plot the following:</strong></p>
<pre><code>plot.bar(m_totals['Month'], m_totals['Showroom Visits']);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This is the error I get if I try to use a period dtype in my charts</strong></p>
<pre><code>ValueError: view limit minimum 0.0 is less than 1 and is an invalid Matplotlib date value. 
</code></pre>
<p>This often happens if you pass a non-datetime value to an axis that has datetime units.</p>
<h2>Additional Material:</h2>
<p>Code I used to create the <code>Month</code> column (where period issue was created):</p>
<p><code>master_df['Month'] = master_df['Entry Date'].dt.to_period('M')</code></p>
<p>Codes I used to group to monthly totals:</p>
<pre><code>m_sums = master_df.groupby(['DealerName','Month']).sum().drop(columns={'Avg. Response Time','Closing Percent'})

m_means = master_df.groupby(['DealerName','Month']).mean()
m_means = m_means[['Avg. Response Time','Closing Percent']]

m_totals = m_sums.join(m_means)
m_totals.reset_index(inplace=True)
m_totals

We create a new controller that should handle tasks associated with a project. We show the tasks on the details page for the particular project. All of this works so far. Then, we add a checkbox that indicates when a task has been completed. The checkbox is in a form that submits on change. 
This is my form code.</p>

<pre><code>user@rpi4:~/01_hello_SDL $ ./hw
Window could not be created! SDL_Error: Could not initialize EGL

<pre><code>SDL_CreateWindow( ""SDL Tutorial"", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN | SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL )

<p>I found a <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/42628/has-anyone-managed-to-get-sdl-2-3-working-without-x-in-raspbian"">post</a> that referenced instructions on how to build SDL2 without X, but I was hoping someone could educate me a bit more about how SDL finds the display in various environments, and if it’s even possible to do what I want to do.</p>

<p>A few years ago I used SDL 1.2 to do full-screen graphics on a Beaglebone Black running a version of Debian, but I seem to have lost that installation, and don’t remember how it was set up. I vaguely recall some issues around fbdev and it being non-accelerated graphics, but that didn’t matter at the time (and while I’d like to get accelerated graphics now, it’s not critical).</p>

Unit testing a method of a class that has a constructor and an autowired field that needs to be mocked using mockito,"<p>I have a service class that extends another service with a constructor. This class has an autowired field and a method that I wanted to unit test using Mockito. However, I am having trouble writing a unit for it.</p>

        .. // construct a State object and return

Pass a pickle buffer from Node to Python,"<p>I have a Node application that subscribes to JSON data streams. I would like to extend this to subscribe to Python pickle data streams (I am willing to drop or convert non primitive types). The node-pickle &amp; jpickle packages have failed me. I now wish to write my own Python script to convert pickles to JSON. </p>

<p>The error I come up against at the moment is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>invalid load key, '\xef'</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>:
I am now sending the buffer string representation, instead of the buffer, to Python. I then use stdin to read it in as bytes. I started writing the bytes object to a file to compare to the data received from Node, to the buffer received when I subscribe to the data stream from a Python script. I have found that they seem to be identical, apart from certain <code>\x..</code> sequences found when subscribing from Python, being represented as <code>\xef\xbf\xbd</code> when subscribing from Node. I assume this has something to do with string encoding?? Some examples of the misrepresented sequences are: <code>\x80</code> (this is the first sequence after the <code>b'</code>; however <code>\x80</code> does appear elsewhere), <code>\xe3</code>, and <code>\x85</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:
I have now encoded the string I'm sending to Python as base64, then, in Python, decoding the stdin buffer using <code>codecs.decode</code>. The buffer I'm writing to the file now looks more identical to the Python only stream, with no more <code>\xef\xbf\xbd</code> substitutions. However, I now come up against this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe3 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I found a slight difference when trying to match the last 1000 characters of each stream. The is a section in the Python stream (<code>\x0c,'\x023</code>) that looks like this (<code>\x0c,\'\x023</code>) in the stream from Node. Not sure how much that'll affect things.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong> (Success!):
After searching up my new error, I found the last piece of this encoding puzzle. Since I was working in Python 3, and the pickle came from Python 2.x, I needed to specify the encoding for <code>pickle.loads</code> as <code>bytes</code> or <code>latin1</code>(the one I needed). I was then able to make use of the wonderful jsonpickle package to do the work of JSON serializing the dict, changing datetime objects into date strings.</p>

Shell/Bash: how to fail on just undefined functions in command-line shell?,"<p>I want to make sure my command-line shell auto fails on just undefined functions. </p>

<p>I do not want my shell scripts to fail on undefined variables since that screws up some external shell scripts that I am sourcing in my .bashrc (Particularly .git-completion.bash starts to misbehave with <code>set -u</code> flag)</p>

<p>I also do not want to fail on return code 1 since that would make my shell unusable (grepping for something that doesn't exist in a file would auto exit my shell).</p>

<p>What I do want is hard stop anytime there is a function used that is undefined. Ideally process interrupt like <code>kill -INT -$$</code> which would stop the current process right than and there but would not exit the shell, but just exiting the shell would work as well as long as it only works on undefined functions and also works when output of the functions is captured. </p>

<p>What I mean by works with output of functions is captured is just setting <code>set -u</code>, <code>set -e</code> doesn't even fully get the job done:</p>

<pre><code>go1(){
  set -u
  set -e

  iDontExist

  echo ""!!! reached operation after undefined !!!""
}
# &gt; go1
# bash: iDontExist: command not found
# Saving session...bash: HISTTIMEFORMAT: unbound variable
</code></pre>

<p>The above works. However if I capture the output the flags do not catch the undefined error (even though I don't even want to use these flags due to the reasons specified at the beginning of the question)</p>

<pre><code>go2(){
  set -u
  set -e
  set -o pipefail

  echo $(iDontExist)

  echo ""!!! reached operation after undefined !!!""
}
# &gt; go2
# bash: iDontExist: command not found
#
# !!! reached operation after undefined !!!

More reliable way to Retrieve Play/Pause Status in Media Player Classic - Home Cinema with AutoHotkey?,"<p>I've been using the Status text of my MPC-HC window to determine if a video is playing or paused. However, when in Fullscreen mode or when the Status bar is hidden, the Status text does not update. Someone pointed out this bug to the MPC-HC team, but it hasn't been resolved: <a href=""https://trac.mpc-hc.org/ticket/5640"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://trac.mpc-hc.org/ticket/5640</a></p>

<p>I've tried using the MPC-HC API to get the state of the media player, but that required I run MPC-HC with the /slave command in order to trigger WM_COPYDATA, which I don't want.</p>

<p>More info on that method here: </p>

<p>I expected the function to return True whenever MPC is playing a video, but it only works if the status bar is visible. It seems that MPC doesn't update the status bar text (Playing/Paused) if it's not visible.</p>

User is Null when using a Service over UserManager,"<p>Using Angular 7 and <a href=""https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OIDC-Client</a> I created an AuthService that exposes a few UserManager methods.</p>

<p>When I call <code>signInRedirectCallback</code> from the AuthService the user is <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>If I call it using UserManager directly the user is not <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>More details below: </p>

<pre><code>const settings : UserManagerSettings = {

};

@Injectable({ 
  providedIn: 'root' 
})

export class AuthService {

  private manager = new UserManager(settings);
  private user: User = null;

  constructor() {

    this.manager.getUser().then(user =&gt; {
      this.user = user;
    });

  }

    return this.user != null &amp;&amp; !this.user.expired;
  }

    return this.user.profile;
  }

    return this.manager.signinRedirect(args);
  }

  signInRedirectCallback(url?: string): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    return this.manager.signinRedirectCallback(url).then(user =&gt; {
      this.user = user;
    });
  }

<p>I have an AuthenticateGuard as follows:</p>

<pre><code>export class AuthenticatedGuard implements CanActivate {

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) { }

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) : boolean {

    if (this.authService.isSignedIn())
      return true;

    this.authService.signInRedirect({ state: { url: state.url }});
    return false;

  }

} 
</code></pre>

<p>Then my callback component is the following:</p>

<pre><code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

import { AuthService } from '../shared/services/auth.service'
import { UserManagerSettings, UserManager } from 'oidc-client';
import { Router, ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

  ngOnInit() {
    this.manager.signinRedirectCallback().then(function (user) {
       console.log(user);
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the callback component <code>user</code> is undefined when I use <code>console.log(user)</code>.</p>

<p>To make this work I needed to create a new UserManager on the SignInComponent (Callback Component) instead of using the AuthService, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>const settings : UserManagerSettings = {
  authority: 'https://localhost:5005',
  client_id: 'spa',
  redirect_uri: 'https://localhost:5001/signin',
  post_logout_redirect_uri: 'https://localhost:5001/signout',
  response_mode: 'query',
  response_type: 'code',
  scope: 'openid profile email offline_access api',
  filterProtocolClaims: true,
  loadUserInfo: true
};

export class SignInComponent implements OnInit {

  private manager = new UserManager(settings);

  constructor(private router: Router) { }

  ngOnInit() {

How would you write a &quot;pure&quot; function that removes an element from a List?,"<p>In Java (or any similar language) how would you write a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pure function</a> (or method) that removes an element from a list. </p>

<p>If the element is in the list, we simply return a new (ideally immutable) list containing all the elements of the input list, minus the element we removed.</p>

<p>But how would you handle the case where the element isn't found in the list?</p>

<p>Let's assume the method receives 2 parameters, the <code>list</code> and the <code>element</code> to remove:</p>

<pre><code>public SOMETHING remove(final List&lt;String&gt; list, final String element){
    // Copy the input list and remove the first occurrence of 'element', if I find it.
    // 
    // if I don't find it ... do something clever here ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I call this method, and <code>element</code> is not contained inside <code>list</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Throwing an exception would presumably make method ""impure"" (?)</li>
<li>Modifying the input list and returning a boolean (similar to <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html#remove(java.lang.Object)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">List#remove()</a>) would presumable make the method ""impure"" (modifying the input would be a side-effect)</li>
<li>Returning the input as output would seem unintuitive to me if I was calling this method.</li>
<li>return an <code>Optional.of(listCopy)</code> (EDIT: added to my question after posting it)</li>
<li>Any other ideas ?</li>
</ul>

<h3>EDIT</h3>

<p>I should have mentioned that I only want to remove the first occurrence of <code>element</code>, so if the input <code>list</code> has multiple occurrences of <code>element</code>, I don't want to remove them all with a sigle call to my remove() method (e.g. using <code>stream().filter()</code>). I just edited the comment in my code example to reflect this. However, this is not fully relevant to my question, as my main question revolves around how to make the method intuitive to use AND remain ""pure"".</p>

<h3>EDIT 2</h3>

<p>I added an additional idea to the above suggestions. Returning <code>Optional.of(listCopy)</code> seems like the most elegant solution of the proposed solutions so far. It forces the caller to check if the requested operation was successful or not, AND (if it was successful), it returns a new list, thereby not modifying the original input list. If the operation was not successful (<code>element</code> wasn't found inside <code>list</code>), the method returns <code>Optional.empty()</code>. It seems to me this would also fulfil the below mentioned <strong>referential integrity</strong>. </p>

Ansible + Kubernetes: how to wait for a Job completion,"<p>Thanks in advance for your time that you spent reading this.</p>

<p>I'm playing with Kubernetes and use Ansible for any interactions with my cluster. Have some playbooks that successfully deploy applications.</p>

<p>My main ansible component I use for deployment is <a href=""https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/k8s_module.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">k8s</a> that allow me to apply my yaml configs.</p>

<p>I can successfully wait until deployment completes using</p>

<pre><code>k8s:
    state: present
    definition: config.yaml
    wait: yes
    wait_timeout: 10
</code></pre>

<p>But, unfortunately, the same trick doesn't work by default with Kubernetes Jobs. The module simply exits immediately that is clearly described in ansible module, that's true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For resource kinds without an implementation, wait returns immediately unless wait_condition is set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To cover such a case, module spec suggests to specify</p>

<pre><code>wait_condition:
  reason: REASON
  type: TYPE
  status: STATUS
</code></pre>

<p>The doc also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The possible types for a condition are specific to each resource type in Kubernetes. See the API documentation of the status field for a given resource to see possible choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I checked API specification and found the same as stated <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/51251664/5114117"">in the following answer</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the only type values are “Complete” and “Failed”, and that they may have a ”True” or ”False” status</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my <strong>QUESTION</strong> is simple: is there anyone who know how to use this <strong>wait_condition</strong> properly? Did you try it already (as for now, it's relatively new feature)?</p>

<p>Any ideas where to look are also appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>That's a kind of workaround I use now:</p>

<pre><code>- name: Run Job
  k8s:
   state: present
   definition: job_definition.yml

- name: Wait Until Job Is Done
  k8s_facts:
    name: job_name
    kind: Job
  register: job_status
  until: job_status.resources[0].status.active != 1
  retries: 10
  delay: 10
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: Get Final Job Status
  k8s_facts:
    name: job_name
    kind: Job
  register: job_status

- fail:
    msg: ""Job Has Been Failed!""
  when: job_status.resources[0].status.failed == 1

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I noticed that the type definition for <code>configureStore()</code> contains the state as the first generic type. See screenshot below.

I restrict my app to work in landscape mode only and I do not have any <code>app/src/main/res/drawable-port-???dpi</code> folders.  The default <code>/app/src/main/res/drawable</code> folder is present but is empty.</p>

<p>I am doing this to avoid lumbering the app with many Mb of never-to-used graphics.  I do not, and do not plan to, provide region/locale specific resources. The localization of UI strings used in my app are handled internally in my own way.</p>

<p>My question - given the above am I likely to run the risk of an ""crash"" as the error message proclaims initially prior to issuing the reassurance quoted above?</p>

<p>It works fine, but is there a way I can expand it such that it can merge files into one file and each file is in a separate worksheet </p>

React Django REST framework session is not persisting/working,"<p>I'm working on a project with Django Rest Framework as back-end and React as front-end.

Running C++ programs in Sublime Text 3 MacOS,"<p>I went to a tech camp this summer and learned how to program using C++ in Visual Studio, but unfortunately, I did not have a Windows computer at home. I tried to get Visual Studio for Mac to work, but I was not successful and decided to try Sublime Text 3. I finally was able to get a simple ""Hello World!"" program to work that I had originally created in Visual Studio at my camp.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello World!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try to make a new program that does the same thing, instead of saying Hello World!, it says: </p>

<pre><code>ld: can't open output file for writing: /Users/David/Desktop/test, 
errno=21 for architecture x86_64

<p>I looked at the folder with the ""Hello World!"" program that I transferred from Visual Studio, and it has another file in it other than the .cpp file that opens up terminal. First it shows 2 file paths followed by exit; and then it shows: </p>

<pre><code>Hello World!
logout
Saving session...
...copying shared history...
...saving history...truncating history files...
...completed.

[Process completed]
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the file that I need to get my new program to work? How do I get this file? Also, another problem I have been having with Sublime Text 3 is that I can't run programs that have multiple files in them. For example, this turn-based text game I made at camp will only print the first line if I run the main .cpp file in the folder. If I run the .sln file, it comes up with an error that says:</p>

How to load base onnx model in ArmNN for Linux in C++,"<p>I am trying to create a C++ standalone app based on ArmNN that operates on ONNX models. To start with I have downloaded a few standard models for testing, and while trying to load the model I see a crash saying ""Tensor numDimensions must be greater than 0"".</p>

<p>The strange thing is, the function that I am invoking to load the model takes just one parameter which is the model name. There is no place for me to specify the dimensions and whatnot. Probably I am doing something wrong here? Or this is not the way to load the model?</p>

<p>I have compiled armnn with support for ONNX as detailed down <a href=""https://developer.arm.com/solutions/machine-learning-on-arm/developer-material/how-to-guides/configuring-the-arm-nn-sdk-build-environment-for-onnx/single-page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. The build and include folders have been copied to a ARM linux machine where I am trying to run the code. I am using a Makefile to compile and run it.</p>

<p>The model I am currently using is download from <a href=""https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/ssd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Initially I was on ArmNN master branch, and while searching for this error message I came across the ArmNN release notes where it was mentioned that the very same error has been fixed in release 19.05. So I switched to tag v19.05 and rebuild everything from scratch and tried to run the application again, but the same error kept popping up.</p>

scikit-learn transformer that bins data based on user supplied cut points,"<p>I am trying to include a transformer in a scikit-learn pipeline that will bin a continuous data column into 4 values based on my own supplied cut points. The current arguments to <a href=""https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer.html#sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KBinsDiscretizer</a> do not work mainly because the <code>strategy</code> argument only accepts <code>{‘uniform’, ‘quantile’, ‘kmeans’}</code>. </p>

<p>There is already the <code>cut()</code> function in <strong>pandas</strong> so I guess that I will need to create a custom transformer that wraps the <code>cut()</code> function behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Desired Behavior (not actual)</strong></p>

<pre><code>X = [[-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]]
est = Discretizer(bins=[-float(""inf""), -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, float(""inf"")], 
                  encode='ordinal')
est.fit(X)  
est.transform(X)
# &gt;&gt;&gt; array([[0., 0., 1., 1., 2., 2., 3.]])
</code></pre>

<p>The result above assumes that the bins includes the rightmost edge and include the lowest. Like this <code>pd.cut()</code> command would provide:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pd.cut(np.array([-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]),
       [-float(""inf""), -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, float(""inf"")], 
       labels=False, right=True, include_lowest=True)

Viewport? or Camera? of Field of View? changes on rotating iOS device,"<p>I have a 3d world using a SceneKit view in my app.</p>

<p>I need to support all iOS devices and orientations.</p>

<p>I do not understand 3d maths, matrices nor really understand cameras and stuff, yet I've built a 3d world, and I have a camera that works, and orbits with a Pan Gesture an object at the centre of the world. </p>

<p>My problem is that when I rotate the device from portrait to landscape the SceneKit view automatically changes it's perspective (of what I'm not sure - the camera? or the world itself?) and the object that looked like it was close, now goes way back into the distance. </p>

<p>What I want to happen is that regardless of rotation the 'viewport'? or camera? or world perspective? stays the same and the distance the camera is from the object doesn't ""look"" different i.e. the object visually stays at the same place. </p>

<p>I have not done any matrix manipulations or set up anything complicated. </p>

<p>I understand that the units of SceneKit are metres, so my object is in the correct size, and the camera is the right number of metres from it... it looks 'correct'</p>

<p>What I don't understand is why it all changes in landscape.</p>

<p>Yes, the SceneKit view is using AutoLayout constraints to hug the edges of the screen. </p>

<p>Here is my camera setup:</p>

<pre class=""lang-swift prettyprint-override""><code>private func setupCamera() -&gt; SCNNode {
    let camera = SCNCamera()
    camera.usesOrthographicProjection = false
    camera.orthographicScale          = 9
    camera.zNear                      = 0.01
    camera.zFar                       = 9500
    camera.focalLength                = 50
    camera.focusDistance              = 33
    camera.fieldOfView                = 100
    let cameraNode                    = SCNNode()
    cameraNode.position               = SCNVector3(x:0, y:0, z: 500.0)
    cameraNode.camera                 = camera
    self.cameraNode                   = cameraNode
    let cameraOrbit                   = SCNNode()

    cameraOrbit.addChildNode(self.cameraNode!)

    return cameraOrbit
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only way I've found to 'fix' this is to make the SceneKit view always be a square and sized so that it's always the largest of the devices width or height and keep it's centre in the screen's centre.</p>

<p>But this approach isn't working with other parts of the app, so instead I know I need to do this 'properly'.</p>

<p>So would someone please provide the code or tell me what I need to understand so that in the function that gets called when the device rotates i.e. <code>override func viewWillTransition(to size: CGSize, with coordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator)</code> then I can correct this automatic change and keep the view's 'perspective' the same. </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Spyder does not release memory for matplotlib plots,"<p>I use Spyder 3.3.6, with Pyhton 3.7.3 over IPyhton 7.7.0 cosole.</p>

<p>For different reasons, Spyder has always been my IDE of choice, but now I have decided to drop it altogether and stick to command prompt only.</p>

<p>The reason is that I have seen a serious memory leak while using matplotlib which is caused by Spyder.</p>

<p>Memory increases linearly until all my 128 GB of memory is consumed to the extend that my Ubuntu machine halted completely and I had to hard reset it. I have had this issue in the past with matplotlib and the solution I found, things like using </p>

<p><code>plt.close('all')</code> or <code>plt.close(fig)</code> or <code>gc.collect()</code> </p>

<p>helped to some extent, but this time none worked (I should add that I am using MNE library to plot a long list of EEG raw files, hence I cannot try every possible solution that exists for such matplotlib memory issues).</p>

<p>But when I ran the same code using both python and ipython in command prompt, a simple</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>plt.close(fig) 
</code></pre>

<p>solved the issue and the memory stays in the order of a few GB during the whole run. Hence, the only logical conclusion is that Spyder somehow messes with the memory management.</p>

<p>So, I wrote this question in case somebody knows a solution to this issue or if not, other people who use Spyder and probably have wasted hours trying to find a python solution would know the issue is in Spyder, not python. </p>

How can I deploy my React app as a subfolder on my personal website using cpanel,"<p>I would like to deploy my react app onto my personal website. I currently have it deployed onto to heroku and have that linked on my personal site. But I would like to eliminate heroku from the equation and have everything on my own site. Whenever I try to deploy it, I upload the build files into my file manager public_html. But when I try to open it, all I get is a blank page. 
I have my vanilla JS projects up just fine. </p>

<p>My question is how do I deploy my react app, through cpanel, onto my existing site.</p>

<p>I've read through some stack pages already and tried npm run build and posting the zip files as well as the normal files to my cpanel file manager. But it only gives me a blank page. 
When I open up dev tools for the blank page I can see that it is the html file I want but and it has the links to my build files but it's just not running them for some reason. The console is giving me an error ""Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()""
I've tried changing the homepage destination as well. </p>

<p>I believe I'm just missing something really simple because I'm having a hard time finding any help on this one. I'm relatively new to react and deploying react apps so if someone could help me I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>I don't know if I am uploading the files to my file manager in cpanel wrong or if I'm doing something wrong with npm run build. </p>

Traditional Data Lake vs AWS Lake Formation,"<p>I have been setting up data lakes for clients wherein we load the data from onprem or any other sources, into the S3 (a data lake).  We will create an AWS Glue catalog on these raw data to create schemas.</p>

<p>The next step would be to either use an EMR or AWS Glue for some data cleansing, load the transformed data into RDS / REDSHIFT / S3 as final target.  </p>

<p>The jobs can be scheduled using Data pipeline, Glue Jobs, or AWS Lambda event trigger depending on the use case / service used.</p>

<p>The analysts, other users would be provided required data / S3 bucket access using IAM service for Quicksight visualizations or data querying using Athena, Drill, etc. or use the data for ML applications in Sagemaker.</p>

<p><strong>My question is how is AWS Lake Formation different from above traditional Data Lakes?</strong>  </p>

<p>I can define that AWS Lake Formation provides all the above services such as S3, Glue Catalog, ETL code generator in Glue, Job scheduler, etc. are available in a single window? With some more advanced security for users / data (record / column level) that can be configured from within the Lake Formation console.</p>

<p>Is there anything else that makes Lake formation stand out from the traditional cloud based Data Lake?</p>

React Router with relative path deployment,"<p>My question is concerning the <code>react-router-dom</code> in conjunction with deployment to a relative path (see <a href=""https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#building-for-relative-paths"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#building-for-relative-paths</a>). On my dev environment the router is working fine, but once i build and deploy my application with the <code>homepage</code> tag set in <code>package.json</code> the router does not seem to work anymore. </p>

<p>First of all i would assume that it would be working. After all it's a build option by react to make a build for a specific url and i would assume the same functionality with that relative path in place. However neither the <code>&lt;Link to=""""&gt;</code> parts nor the <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> do respect the relative path of my react app.</p>

<p>Second of all i have not found a solution to circumvent this behavior. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Other question dealing with react router and relative paths are focusing on a totally different topic. So i have not found an answer to my question. This <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50250223/react-router-app-deployed-on-different-locations-subdirectories"">React-router app deployed on different locations (subdirectories)</a> is maybe getting close and could be a way to deal with that.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT and PS:</strong></p>

<p>I would probably just need to set a basename. If the basename is changing i would at least want to infer it from the setting in the <code>package.json</code> and not change my code depending on some <code>package.json</code> setting.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p><em>I could use <code>basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}</code> to set the basename to the correct URL. However the routes are still not matching. The links however appear to be fine, so <code>&lt;Link to=""/xx""&gt;</code> would actually result in an link to <code>{process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/xx</code> which is the desired behavior, but the routers <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> does not match them.</em> <strong>Actually this is the answer and you can scratch that.</strong> </p>

Using Entity Framework with Multiple Databases and Providers in the Same Project (SQL Server and MySql),"<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>I have an application (both web forms and console) that easily accesses multiple SQL Server databases using Entity Framework code first with no problems. I can switch back and forth between contexts with no errors. Now I'm trying to add in a new MySql database (different provider), but if I switch from one context to another, I get the below error message: </p>

<h2>Error:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default DbConfiguration instance was used by the Entity Framework
  before the 'MySqlEFConfiguration' type was discovered. An instance of
  'MySqlEFConfiguration' must be set at application start before using

</blockquote>

<p>I've seen solutions that recommend adding the ""codeConfigurationType"" attribute to the entityFramework node in the web.config to specify my MySql assembly, but this won't work since I'm targeting multiple databases with multiple providers. </p>

<p>The Microsoft support article seems to hint at creating my own custom DbConfiguration file, but I already have one: MySql.Data.Entity.mySqlEFConfiguration, and I've decorated my DbContext with it accordingly: </p>

        {

        }
    }

  &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>It doesn't seem like there's any way to do this using config file configuration since I'm limited to a single  entry. So how can I specify the provider when switching contexts? I imagine there's something I'm missing in each DbContext's constructor to explicitly state which provider to use? For the record, I'm receiving the same error message in both a console application and a web forms application. </p>

<h2>Update: Additional Info</h2>

<ul>
<li>(8/21/19) It seems to work okay if I disable MultipleActiveResultSets (MARS) on the SQLServer data sources, though this isn't an ideal solution since I've written my code to take advantage of MARS.</li>
<li>(8/22/19) Actually that wouldn't have solved it. It would have just gone on to the next problem. There can only be one DbConfiguration per application, so the solution will likely involve writing one that works with both providers... I've submitted a support request with my MSDN subscription to see if they have any additional insight...</li>

<pre><code>ActiveCell.Offset(0, 3).Value = Format(Now(), ""dd/mm/yyyy"")
     ActiveCell.Offset(0, 3).Value = Format(Me.txtBrewDate.Value, ""dd/mm/yyyy"")

Determine which Flipfont package is active (and use it on WebViews),"<p>First I should explain what my ultimate goal is. I develop Android Apps, mostly using WebViews. They are great in various aspects, but one thing they don't do very well is ""matching the native UI"", especially fonts. Some phones (such as Samsung's) support using <a href=""https://www.monotype.com/products/flipfont/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flipfont</a> to switch the default font for the entire system, but for some reasons, no browsers (as far as I know) adapt that setting and display webpages with the Flipfont settings. The same is true for WebViews, and thus creating inconsistent user experience.</p>

<p>But I think there should be a way to let WebViews using the Flipfont font. By studying the decompiled source code of <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kapp.ifont"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iFont</a>, I think I've figured out how to extract the .ttf file from the assets of a given Flipfont package, of which the package name always begins with <code>com.monotype.android.font</code>. And after that, I supposedly can let the WebView use that .ttf file as the default font. The problem is, I don't know which package I should extract, that is, I don't know which Flipfont package is currently in use, if any. It appears that iFont cannot determine that either; there's no place in that app that tells me explicitly ""You're using font xxx"".</p>

<p>But obviously there must be a way to determine that, because the Flipfont setting dialog shows me exactly that. However, I failed to decompile the setting dialog to study how it is done. From Logcat, it appears that the setting dialog has something to do with the package <code>com.sec.android.easysettings</code> and <code>com.android.settings</code>, but decompiling the corresponding apk's (which are under <code>/system/app/easysettings</code> and <code>/system/priv-app/SecSettings</code>, respectively) both result in no source code at all, only resources (can someone also explain why this happens?).</p>

<p>So does anyone know how to determine the current Flipfont package?</p>

<p>2.Then I saw some one use <strong>sys</strong> to append the path, so I write it in front of my code:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages')
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
</code></pre>

<p>Then I got:</p>

<p><strong>ImportError: this version of pandas is incompatible with numpy &lt; 1.13.3</strong></p>

<p><strong>your numpy version is 1.8.0rc1.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please upgrade numpy to >= 1.13.3 to use this pandas version</strong></p>

<p>But my numpy version is 1.17, I have upgraded.</p>

<p>So I just want know what I should do to make the pandas can be used in VScode?</p>

How to enforce authorization checks in every controller method?,"<p>I'm implementing <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/resourcebased?view=aspnetcore-2.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Resource-based authorization in ASP.NET Core</a> in my web API.</p>

<p>I would like to force programmers to always call <code>_authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync</code> in every controller method.</p>

<p><strong>How do I ensure that a <code>403 Unauthorized</code> response is returned if some controller method completes without having at least once called <code>AuthorizeAsync</code>?</strong></p>

<p>I could also consider an attribute or some other way to explicitly mark a controller method as available without authorization. The main idea is to apply the principle ""deny all, then allow some"" and to prevent security holes just because somebody forgot to add an <code>AuthorizeAsync</code> call.</p>

How to wrap height of Android ViewPager2 to height of current item?,"<p>This question is for the new <strong>ViewPager2</strong> class.</p>

However, ViewPager2 is final so cannot be extended.</p>

<p>In my situation, I have a ViewPager2 that contains three different fragments. One of these fragments is much taller than the other two, which means when you swipe to one of the shorter fragments, there is a lot of empty space. So how do I effectively wrap the ViewPager2 to the height of the current fragment?</p>
